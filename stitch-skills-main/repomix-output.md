# Design System: Furniture Collections List
**Project ID:** 13534454087919359824

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

The Furniture Collections List embodies a **sophisticated, minimalist sanctuary** that marries the pristine simplicity of Scandinavian design with the refined visual language of luxury editorial presentation. The interface feels **spacious and tranquil**, prioritizing breathing room and visual clarity above all else. The design philosophy is gallery-like and photography-first, allowing each furniture piece to command attention as an individual art object.

The overall mood is **airy yet grounded**, creating an aspirational aesthetic that remains approachable and welcoming. The interface feels **utilitarian in its restraint** but elegant in its execution, with every element serving a clear purpose while maintaining visual sophistication. The atmosphere evokes the serene ambiance of a high-end furniture showroom where customers can browse thoughtfully without visual overwhelm.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Expansive whitespace creating generous breathing room between elements
- Clean, architectural grid system with structured content blocks
- Photography-first presentation with minimal UI interference
- Whisper-soft visual hierarchy that guides without shouting
- Refined, understated interactive elements
- Professional yet inviting editorial tone

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary Foundation
- **Warm Barely-There Cream** (#FCFAFA) – Primary background color. Creates an almost imperceptible warmth that feels more inviting than pure white, serving as the serene canvas for the entire experience.
- **Crisp Very Light Gray** (#F5F5F5) – Secondary surface color used for card backgrounds and content areas. Provides subtle visual separation while maintaining the airy, ethereal quality.

### Accent & Interactive
- **Deep Muted Teal-Navy** (#294056) – The sole vibrant accent in the palette. Used exclusively for primary call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Shop Now", "View all products"), active navigation links, selected filter states, and subtle interaction highlights. This sophisticated anchor color creates visual focus points without disrupting the serene neutral foundation.

### Typography & Text Hierarchy
- **Charcoal Near-Black** (#2C2C2C) – Primary text color for headlines and product names. Provides strong readable contrast while being softer and more refined than pure black.
- **Soft Warm Gray** (#6B6B6B) – Secondary text used for body copy, product descriptions, and supporting metadata. Creates clear typographic hierarchy without harsh contrast.
- **Ultra-Soft Silver Gray** (#E0E0E0) – Tertiary color for borders, dividers, and subtle structural elements. Creates separation so gentle it's almost imperceptible.

### Functional States (Reserved for system feedback)
- **Success Moss** (#10B981) – Stock availability, confirmation states, positive indicators
- **Alert Terracotta** (#EF4444) – Low stock warnings, error states, critical alerts
- **Informational Slate** (#64748B) – Neutral system messages, informational callouts

## 3. Typography Rules

**Primary Font Family:** Manrope  
**Character:** Modern, geometric sans-serif with gentle humanist warmth. Slightly rounded letterforms that feel contemporary yet approachable.

### Hierarchy & Weights
- **Display Headlines (H1):** Semi-bold weight (600), generous letter-spacing (0.02em for elegance), 2.75-3.5rem size. Used sparingly for hero sections and major page titles.
- **Section Headers (H2):** Semi-bold weight (600), subtle letter-spacing (0.01em), 2-2.5rem size. Establishes clear content zones and featured collections.
- **Subsection Headers (H3):** Medium weight (500), normal letter-spacing, 1.5-1.75rem size. Product names and category labels.
- **Body Text:** Regular weight (400), relaxed line-height (1.7), 1rem size. Descriptions and supporting content prioritize comfortable readability.
- **Small Text/Meta:** Regular weight (400), slightly tighter line-height (1.5), 0.875rem size. Prices, availability, and metadata remain legible but visually recessive.
- **CTA Buttons:** Medium weight (500), subtle letter-spacing (0.01em), 1rem size. Balanced presence without visual aggression.

### Spacing Principles
- Headers use slightly expanded letter-spacing for refined elegance
- Body text maintains generous line-height (1.7) for effortless reading
- Consistent vertical rhythm with 2-3rem between related text blocks
- Large margins (4-6rem) between major sections to reinforce spaciousness

## 4. Component Stylings

### Buttons
- **Shape:** Subtly rounded corners (8px/0.5rem radius) – approachable and modern without appearing playful or childish
- **Primary CTA:** Deep Muted Teal-Navy (#294056) background with pure white text, comfortable padding (0.875rem vertical, 2rem horizontal)
- **Hover State:** Subtle darkening to deeper navy, smooth 250ms ease-in-out transition
- **Focus State:** Soft outer glow in the primary color for keyboard navigation accessibility
- **Secondary CTA (if needed):** Outlined style with Deep Muted Teal-Navy border, transparent background, hover fills with whisper-soft teal tint

### Cards & Product Containers
- **Corner Style:** Gently rounded corners (12px/0.75rem radius) creating soft, refined edges
- **Background:** Alternates between Warm Barely-There Cream and Crisp Very Light Gray based on layering needs
- **Shadow Strategy:** Flat by default. On hover, whisper-soft diffused shadow appears (`0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`) creating subtle depth
- **Border:** Optional hairline border (1px) in Ultra-Soft Silver Gray for delicate definition when shadows aren't present
- **Internal Padding:** Generous 2-2.5rem creating comfortable breathing room for content
- **Image Treatment:** Full-bleed at the top of cards, square or 4:3 ratio, seamless edge-to-edge presentation

### Navigation
- **Style:** Clean horizontal layout with generous spacing (2-3rem) between menu items
- **Typography:** Medium weight (500), subtle uppercase, expanded letter-spacing (0.06em) for refined sophistication
- **Default State:** Charcoal Near-Black text
- **Active/Hover State:** Smooth 200ms color transition to Deep Muted Teal-Navy
- **Active Indicator:** Thin underline (2px) in Deep Muted Teal-Navy appearing below current section
- **Mobile:** Converts to elegant hamburger menu with sliding drawer

### Inputs & Forms
- **Stroke Style:** Refined 1px border in Soft Warm Gray
- **Background:** Warm Barely-There Cream with transition to Crisp Very Light Gray on focus
- **Corner Style:** Matching button roundness (8px/0.5rem) for visual consistency
- **Focus State:** Border color shifts to Deep Muted Teal-Navy with subtle outer glow
- **Padding:** Comfortable 0.875rem vertical, 1.25rem horizontal for touch-friendly targets
- **Placeholder Text:** Ultra-Soft Silver Gray, elegant and unobtrusive

### Product Cards (Specific Pattern)
- **Image Area:** Square (1:1) or landscape (4:3) ratio filling card width completely
- **Content Stack:** Product name (H3), brief descriptor, material/finish, price
- **Price Display:** Emphasized with semi-bold weight (600) in Charcoal Near-Black
- **Hover Behavior:** Gentle lift effect (translateY -4px) combined with enhanced shadow
- **Spacing:** Consistent 1.5rem internal padding below image

## 5. Layout Principles

### Grid & Structure
- **Max Content Width:** 1440px for optimal readability and visual balance on large displays
- **Grid System:** Responsive 12-column grid with fluid gutters (24px mobile, 32px desktop)
- **Product Grid:** 4 columns on large desktop, 3 on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile
- **Breakpoints:** 
  - Mobile: <768px
  - Tablet: 768-1024px  
  - Desktop: 1024-1440px
  - Large Desktop: >1440px

### Whitespace Strategy (Critical to the Design)
- **Base Unit:** 8px for micro-spacing, 16px for component spacing
- **Vertical Rhythm:** Consistent 2rem (32px) base unit between related elements
- **Section Margins:** Generous 5-8rem (80-128px) between major sections creating dramatic breathing room
- **Edge Padding:** 1.5rem (24px) mobile, 3rem (48px) tablet/desktop for comfortable framing
- **Hero Sections:** Extra-generous top/bottom padding (8-12rem) for impactful presentation

### Alignment & Visual Balance
- **Text Alignment:** Left-aligned for body and navigation (optimal readability), centered for hero headlines and featured content
- **Image to Text Ratio:** Heavily weighted toward imagery (70-30 split) reinforcing photography-first philosophy
- **Asymmetric Balance:** Large hero images offset by compact, refined text blocks
- **Visual Weight Distribution:** Strategic use of whitespace to draw eyes to hero products and primary CTAs
- **Reading Flow:** Clear top-to-bottom, left-to-right pattern with intentional focal points

### Responsive Behavior & Touch
- **Mobile-First Foundation:** Core experience designed and perfected for smallest screens first
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Additional columns, imagery, and details added gracefully at larger breakpoints
- **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements (WCAG AAA compliant)
- **Image Optimization:** Responsive images with appropriate resolutions for each breakpoint, lazy-loading for performance
- **Collapsing Strategy:** Navigation collapses to hamburger, grid reduces columns, padding scales proportionally

## 6. Design System Notes for Stitch Generation

When creating new screens for this project using Stitch, reference these specific instructions:

### Language to Use
- **Atmosphere:** "Sophisticated minimalist sanctuary with gallery-like spaciousness"
- **Button Shapes:** "Subtly rounded corners" (not "rounded-md" or "8px")
- **Shadows:** "Whisper-soft diffused shadows on hover" (not "shadow-sm")
- **Spacing:** "Generous breathing room" and "expansive whitespace"

### Color References
Always use the descriptive names with hex codes:
- Primary CTA: "Deep Muted Teal-Navy (#294056)"
- Backgrounds: "Warm Barely-There Cream (#FCFAFA)" or "Crisp Very Light Gray (#F5F5F5)"
- Text: "Charcoal Near-Black (#2C2C2C)" or "Soft Warm Gray (#6B6B6B)"

### Component Prompts
- "Create a product card with gently rounded corners, full-bleed square product image, and whisper-soft shadow on hover"
- "Design a primary call-to-action button in Deep Muted Teal-Navy (#294056) with subtle rounded corners and comfortable padding"
- "Add a navigation bar with generous spacing between items, using medium-weight Manrope with subtle uppercase and expanded letter-spacing"

### Incremental Iteration
When refining existing screens:
1. Focus on ONE component at a time (e.g., "Update the product grid cards")
2. Be specific about what to change (e.g., "Increase the internal padding of product cards from 1.5rem to 2rem")
3. Reference this design system language consistently

# Stitch DESIGN.md Skill

You are an expert Design Systems Lead. Your goal is to analyze the provided technical assets and synthesize a "Semantic Design System" into a file named `DESIGN.md`.

## Overview

This skill helps you create `DESIGN.md` files that serve as the "source of truth" for prompting Stitch to generate new screens that align perfectly with existing design language. Stitch interprets design through "Visual Descriptions" supported by specific color values.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Stitch MCP Server
- A Stitch project with at least one designed screen
- Access to the Stitch Effective Prompting Guide: https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/learn/prompting/

## The Goal

The `DESIGN.md` file will serve as the "source of truth" for prompting Stitch to generate new screens that align perfectly with the existing design language. Stitch interprets design through "Visual Descriptions" supported by specific color values.

## Retrieval and Networking

To analyze a Stitch project, you must retrieve screen metadata and design assets using the Stitch MCP Server tools:

1. **Namespace discovery**: Run `list_tools` to find the Stitch MCP prefix. Use this prefix (e.g., `mcp_stitch:`) for all subsequent calls.

2. **Project lookup** (if Project ID is not provided):
   - Call `[prefix]:list_projects` with `filter: "view=owned"` to retrieve all user projects
   - Identify the target project by title or URL pattern
   - Extract the Project ID from the `name` field (e.g., `projects/13534454087919359824`)

3. **Screen lookup** (if Screen ID is not provided):
   - Call `[prefix]:list_screens` with the `projectId` (just the numeric ID, not the full path)
   - Review screen titles to identify the target screen (e.g., "Home", "Landing Page")
   - Extract the Screen ID from the screen's `name` field

4. **Metadata fetch**: 
   - Call `[prefix]:get_screen` with both `projectId` and `screenId` (both as numeric IDs only)
   - This returns the complete screen object including:
     - `screenshot.downloadUrl` - Visual reference of the design
     - `htmlCode.downloadUrl` - Full HTML/CSS source code
     - `width`, `height`, `deviceType` - Screen dimensions and target platform
     - Project metadata including `designTheme` with color and style information

5. **Asset download**:
   - Use `web_fetch` or `read_url_content` to download the HTML code from `htmlCode.downloadUrl`
   - Optionally download the screenshot from `screenshot.downloadUrl` for visual reference
   - Parse the HTML to extract Tailwind classes, custom CSS, and component patterns

6. **Project metadata extraction**:
   - Call `[prefix]:get_project` with the project `name` (full path: `projects/{id}`) to get:
     - `designTheme` object with color mode, fonts, roundness, custom colors
     - Project-level design guidelines and descriptions
     - Device type preferences and layout principles

## Analysis & Synthesis Instructions

### 1. Extract Project Identity (JSON)
- Locate the Project Title
- Locate the specific Project ID (e.g., from the `name` field in the JSON)

### 2. Define the Atmosphere (Image/HTML)
Evaluate the screenshot and HTML structure to capture the overall "vibe." Use evocative adjectives to describe the mood (e.g., "Airy," "Dense," "Minimalist," "Utilitarian").

### 3. Map the Color Palette (Tailwind Config/JSON)
Identify the key colors in the system. For each color, provide:
- A descriptive, natural language name that conveys its character (e.g., "Deep Muted Teal-Navy")
- The specific hex code in parentheses for precision (e.g., "#294056")
- Its specific functional role (e.g., "Used for primary actions")

### 4. Translate Geometry & Shape (CSS/Tailwind)
Convert technical `border-radius` and layout values into physical descriptions:
- Describe `rounded-full` as "Pill-shaped"
- Describe `rounded-lg` as "Subtly rounded corners"
- Describe `rounded-none` as "Sharp, squared-off edges"

### 5. Describe Depth & Elevation
Explain how the UI handles layers. Describe the presence and quality of shadows (e.g., "Flat," "Whisper-soft diffused shadows," or "Heavy, high-contrast drop shadows").

## Output Guidelines

- **Language:** Use descriptive design terminology and natural language exclusively
- **Format:** Generate a clean Markdown file following the structure below
- **Precision:** Include exact hex codes for colors while using descriptive names
- **Context:** Explain the "why" behind design decisions, not just the "what"

## Output Format (DESIGN.md Structure)

```markdown
# Design System: [Project Title]
**Project ID:** [Insert Project ID Here]

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
(Description of the mood, density, and aesthetic philosophy.)

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
(List colors by Descriptive Name + Hex Code + Functional Role.)

## 3. Typography Rules
(Description of font family, weight usage for headers vs. body, and letter-spacing character.)

## 4. Component Stylings
* **Buttons:** (Shape description, color assignment, behavior).
* **Cards/Containers:** (Corner roundness description, background color, shadow depth).
* **Inputs/Forms:** (Stroke style, background).

## 5. Layout Principles
(Description of whitespace strategy, margins, and grid alignment.)
```

## Usage Example

To use this skill for the Furniture Collection project:

1. **Retrieve project information:**
   ```
   Use the Stitch MCP Server to get the Furniture Collection project
   ```

2. **Get the Home page screen details:**
   ```
   Retrieve the Home page screen's code, image, and screen object information
   ```

3. **Reference best practices:**
   ```
   Review the Stitch Effective Prompting Guide at:
   https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/learn/prompting/
   ```

4. **Analyze and synthesize:**
   - Extract all relevant design tokens from the screen
   - Translate technical values into descriptive language
   - Organize information according to the DESIGN.md structure

5. **Generate the file:**
   - Create `DESIGN.md` in the project directory
   - Follow the prescribed format exactly
   - Ensure all color codes are accurate
   - Use evocative, designer-friendly language

## Best Practices

- **Be Descriptive:** Avoid generic terms like "blue" or "rounded." Use "Ocean-deep Cerulean (#0077B6)" or "Gently curved edges"
- **Be Functional:** Always explain what each design element is used for
- **Be Consistent:** Use the same terminology throughout the document
- **Be Visual:** Help readers visualize the design through your descriptions
- **Be Precise:** Include exact values (hex codes, pixel values) in parentheses after natural language descriptions

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with the big picture:** Understand the overall aesthetic before diving into details
2. **Look for patterns:** Identify consistent spacing, sizing, and styling patterns
3. **Think semantically:** Name colors by their purpose, not just their appearance
4. **Consider hierarchy:** Document how visual weight and importance are communicated
5. **Reference the guide:** Use language and patterns from the Stitch Effective Prompting Guide

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Using technical jargon without translation (e.g., "rounded-xl" instead of "generously rounded corners")
- ❌ Omitting color codes or using only descriptive names
- ❌ Forgetting to explain functional roles of design elements
- ❌ Being too vague in atmosphere descriptions
- ❌ Ignoring subtle design details like shadows or spacing patterns

# Enhance Prompt for Stitch

You are a **Stitch Prompt Engineer**. Your job is to transform rough or vague UI generation ideas into polished, optimized prompts that produce better results from Stitch.

## Prerequisites

Before enhancing prompts, consult the official Stitch documentation for the latest best practices:

- **Stitch Effective Prompting Guide**: https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/learn/prompting/

This guide contains up-to-date recommendations that may supersede or complement the patterns in this skill.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when a user wants to:
- Polish a UI prompt before sending to Stitch
- Improve a prompt that produced poor results
- Add design system consistency to a simple idea
- Structure a vague concept into an actionable prompt

## Enhancement Pipeline

Follow these steps to enhance any prompt:

### Step 1: Assess the Input

Evaluate what's missing from the user's prompt:

| Element | Check for | If missing... |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Platform** | "web", "mobile", "desktop" | Add based on context or ask |
| **Page type** | "landing page", "dashboard", "form" | Infer from description |
| **Structure** | Numbered sections/components | Create logical page structure |
| **Visual style** | Adjectives, mood, vibe | Add appropriate descriptors |
| **Colors** | Specific values or roles | Add design system or suggest |
| **Components** | UI-specific terms | Translate to proper keywords |

### Step 2: Check for DESIGN.md

Look for a `DESIGN.md` file in the current project:

**If DESIGN.md exists:**
1. Read the file to extract the design system block
2. Include the color palette, typography, and component styles
3. Format as a "DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED)" section in the output

**If DESIGN.md does not exist:**
1. Add this note at the end of the enhanced prompt:

```
---
💡 **Tip:** For consistent designs across multiple screens, create a DESIGN.md 
file using the `design-md` skill. This ensures all generated pages share the 
same visual language.
```

### Step 3: Apply Enhancements

Transform the input using these techniques:

#### A. Add UI/UX Keywords

Replace vague terms with specific component names:

| Vague | Enhanced |
|-------|----------|
| "menu at the top" | "navigation bar with logo and menu items" |
| "button" | "primary call-to-action button" |
| "list of items" | "card grid layout" or "vertical list with thumbnails" |
| "form" | "form with labeled input fields and submit button" |
| "picture area" | "hero section with full-width image" |

#### B. Amplify the Vibe

Add descriptive adjectives to set the mood:

| Basic | Enhanced |
|-------|----------|
| "modern" | "clean, minimal, with generous whitespace" |
| "professional" | "sophisticated, trustworthy, with subtle shadows" |
| "fun" | "vibrant, playful, with rounded corners and bold colors" |
| "dark mode" | "dark theme with high-contrast accents on deep backgrounds" |

#### C. Structure the Page

Organize content into numbered sections:

```markdown
**Page Structure:**
1. **Header:** Navigation with logo and menu items
2. **Hero Section:** Headline, subtext, and primary CTA
3. **Content Area:** [Describe the main content]
4. **Footer:** Links, social icons, copyright
```

#### D. Format Colors Properly

When colors are mentioned, format them as:
```
Descriptive Name (#hexcode) for functional role
```

Examples:
- "Deep Ocean Blue (#1a365d) for primary buttons and links"
- "Warm Cream (#faf5f0) for page background"
- "Soft Gray (#6b7280) for secondary text"

### Step 4: Format the Output

Structure the enhanced prompt in this order:

```markdown
[One-line description of the page purpose and vibe]

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
- Platform: [Web/Mobile], [Desktop/Mobile]-first
- Theme: [Light/Dark], [style descriptors]
- Background: [Color description] (#hex)
- Primary Accent: [Color description] (#hex) for [role]
- Text Primary: [Color description] (#hex)
- [Additional design tokens...]

**Page Structure:**
1. **[Section]:** [Description]
2. **[Section]:** [Description]
...
```

## Output Options

**Default:** Return the enhanced prompt as text for the user to copy.

**Optional file output:** If the user requests, write to a file:
- `next-prompt.md` — for use with the `stitch-loop` skill
- Custom filename specified by user

## Examples

### Example 1: Vague Input → Structured Prompt

**User input:**
> "make me a login page"

**Enhanced output:**
```markdown
A clean, trustworthy login page with a centered form and subtle branding.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
- Platform: Web, Desktop-first
- Theme: Light, minimal, professional
- Background: Clean White (#ffffff)
- Surface: Soft Gray (#f9fafb) for form card
- Primary Accent: Deep Blue (#2563eb) for submit button and links
- Text Primary: Near Black (#111827) for headings
- Text Secondary: Medium Gray (#6b7280) for labels
- Buttons: Subtly rounded (8px), full-width on form
- Cards: Gently rounded (12px), soft shadow for elevation

**Page Structure:**
1. **Header:** Minimal logo, centered
2. **Login Card:** Centered form with email, password fields, "Forgot password?" link
3. **Submit Button:** Primary blue "Sign In" button
4. **Footer:** "Don't have an account? Sign up" link

---
💡 **Tip:** For consistent designs across multiple screens, create a DESIGN.md 
file using the `design-md` skill.
```

### Example 2: Feature Request → Targeted Edit

**User input:**
> "add a search bar"

**Enhanced output:**
```markdown
Add a search bar to the header navigation.

**Specific changes:**
- Location: Header, right side before user avatar
- Style: Pill-shaped input with subtle gray background (#f3f4f6)
- Icon: Magnifying glass icon on the left, inside the input
- Placeholder: "Search..." in light gray (#9ca3af)
- Behavior: Expands on focus with subtle shadow
- Width: 240px default, 320px on focus

**Context:** This is a targeted edit. Make only this change while preserving all existing elements.
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific early** — Vague inputs need more enhancement
2. **Match the user's intent** — Don't over-design if they want simple
3. **Keep it structured** — Numbered sections help Stitch understand hierarchy
4. **Include the design system** — Consistency is key for multi-page projects
5. **One change at a time for edits** — Don't bundle unrelated changes

# Architecture Quality Gate

### Structural integrity
- [ ] Logic extracted to custom hooks in `src/hooks/`.
- [ ] No monolithic files; strictly Atomic/Composite modularity.
- [ ] All static text/URLs moved to `src/data/mockData.ts`.

### Type safety and syntax
- [ ] Props use `Readonly<T>` interfaces.
- [ ] File is syntactically valid TypeScript (no red squiggles).
- [ ] Placeholders from templates (e.g., `StitchComponent`) have been replaced with actual names.

### Styling and theming
- [ ] Dark mode (`dark:`) applied to all color classes.
- [ ] No hardcoded hex values; use theme-mapped Tailwind classes.

# Stitch API reference

This document describes the data structures returned by the Stitch MCP server to ensure accurate component mapping.

### Metadata schema
When calling `get_screen`, the server returns a JSON object with these key properties:
* **htmlCode**: Contains a `downloadUrl`. This is a signed URL that requires a system-level fetch (curl) to handle redirects and security handshakes.
* **screenshot**: Includes a `downloadUrl` for the visual design. Use this to verify layout intent that might not be obvious in the raw HTML.
* **deviceType**: Usually set to `DESKTOP`. All generated components should prioritize the corresponding viewport (2560px width) as the base layout.

### Technical mapping rules
1. **Element tracking**: Preserve `data-stitch-id` attributes as comments in the TSX to allow for future design synchronization.
2. **Asset handling**: Treat background images in the HTML as dynamic data. Extract the URLs into `mockData.ts` rather than hardcoding them into the component styles.
3. **Style extraction**: The HTML `<head>` contains a localized `tailwind.config`. This config must be merged with the local project theme to ensure colors like `primary` and `background-dark` render correctly.

# Stitch to React Components Skill

## Install

```bash
npx skills add google-labs-code/stitch-skills --skill react:components --global
```

## Example Prompt

```text
Convert my Landing Page screen in my Podcast Stitch Project to a React component system.
```

## Skill Structure

This repository follows the **Agent Skills** open standard. Each skill is self-contained with its own logic, validation scripts, and design tokens.

```text
skills/react-components/
├── SKILL.md           — Core instructions & workflow
├── package.json       — Validator dependencies
├── scripts/           — Networking & AST validation
├── resources/         — Style guides & API references
└── examples/          — Gold-standard code samples
```

## How it Works

When activated, the agent follows a high-fidelity engineering pipeline:

1. **Retrieval**: Uses a system-level `curl` script to bypass TLS/SNI issues on Google Cloud Storage.
2. **Mapping**: Cross-references Stitch metadata with the local `style-guide.json` to ensure token consistency.
3. **Generation**: Scaffolds components using a strict Atomic Design pattern.
4. **Validation**: Runs an automated AST check using `@swc/core` to prevent hardcoded hex values or missing interfaces.
5. **Audit**: Performs a final self-correction check against a 20-point architecture checklist.

# Stitch to React Components

You are a frontend engineer focused on transforming designs into clean React code. You follow a modular approach and use automated tools to ensure code quality.

## Retrieval and networking
1. **Namespace discovery**: Run `list_tools` to find the Stitch MCP prefix. Use this prefix (e.g., `stitch:`) for all subsequent calls.
2. **Metadata fetch**: Call `[prefix]:get_screen` to retrieve the design JSON.
3. **Check for existing designs**: Before downloading, check if `.stitch/designs/{page}.html` and `.stitch/designs/{page}.png` already exist:
   - **If files exist**: Ask the user whether to refresh the designs from the Stitch project using the MCP, or reuse the existing local files. Only re-download if the user confirms.
   - **If files do not exist**: Proceed to step 4.
4. **High-reliability download**: Internal AI fetch tools can fail on Google Cloud Storage domains.
   - **HTML**: `bash scripts/fetch-stitch.sh "[htmlCode.downloadUrl]" ".stitch/designs/{page}.html"`
    - **Screenshot**: Append `=w{width}` to the screenshot URL first, where `{width}` is the `width` value from the screen metadata (Google CDN serves low-res thumbnails by default). Then run: `bash scripts/fetch-stitch.sh "[screenshot.downloadUrl]=w{width}" ".stitch/designs/{page}.png"`
   - This script handles the necessary redirects and security handshakes.
5. **Visual audit**: Review the downloaded screenshot (`.stitch/designs/{page}.png`) to confirm design intent and layout details.

## Architectural rules
* **Modular components**: Break the design into independent files. Avoid large, single-file outputs.
* **Logic isolation**: Move event handlers and business logic into custom hooks in `src/hooks/`.
* **Data decoupling**: Move all static text, image URLs, and lists into `src/data/mockData.ts`.
* **Type safety**: Every component must include a `Readonly` TypeScript interface named `[ComponentName]Props`.
* **Project specific**: Focus on the target project's needs and constraints. Leave Google license headers out of the generated React components.
* **Style mapping**:
    * Extract the `tailwind.config` from the HTML `<head>`.
    * Sync these values with `resources/style-guide.json`.
    * Use theme-mapped Tailwind classes instead of arbitrary hex codes.

## Execution steps
1. **Environment setup**: If `node_modules` is missing, run `npm install` to enable the validation tools.
2. **Data layer**: Create `src/data/mockData.ts` based on the design content.
3. **Component drafting**: Use `resources/component-template.tsx` as a base. Find and replace all instances of `StitchComponent` with the actual name of the component you are creating.
4. **Application wiring**: Update the project entry point (like `App.tsx`) to render the new components.
5. **Quality check**:
    * Run `npm run validate <file_path>` for each component.
    * Verify the final output against the `resources/architecture-checklist.md`.
    * Start the dev server with `npm run dev` to verify the live result.

## Troubleshooting
* **Fetch errors**: Ensure the URL is quoted in the bash command to prevent shell errors.
* **Validation errors**: Review the AST report and fix any missing interfaces or hardcoded styles.

# Stitch-Remotion Video Walkthrough Skill

Generate professional walkthrough videos from Stitch app designs using Remotion.

## What This Skill Does

This skill bridges Stitch (UI design platform) and Remotion (programmatic video library) to automatically create walkthrough videos showcasing app screens with:

- **Smooth transitions**: Cross-fades, slides, and zoom effects
- **Text overlays**: Screen titles, descriptions, and feature callouts
- **Professional animations**: Spring-based natural motion
- **Customizable timing**: Control display duration per screen

## Prerequisites

1. **Stitch MCP Server**: Access to retrieve screens from Stitch projects
2. **Node.js**: For running Remotion
3. **Remotion**: Either Remotion MCP Server or Remotion CLI

## Example Use Case

**User Request:**
> "Look up the screens in my Stitch project 'Calculator App' and build a remotion video that shows a walkthrough of the screens."

**What Happens:**
1. Agent retrieves all screens from the Stitch project
2. Downloads screenshots for each screen
3. Creates a Remotion composition with transitions
4. Generates video with smooth animations and text overlays
5. Renders final MP4 video

## Key Features

- **Automated asset retrieval** from Stitch projects
- **Modular Remotion components** for easy customization
- **Multiple transition styles** (fade, slide, zoom)
- **Text overlay system** for annotations
- **Configurable timing** per screen
- **Professional rendering** with quality optimization

## Installation

Install this skill using:

```bash
npx skills add google-labs-code/stitch-skills --skill remotion --global
```

## File Structure

When using this skill, the agent will create:

```
project/
├── video/                      # Remotion project
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── WalkthroughComposition.tsx
│   │   ├── ScreenSlide.tsx
│   │   └── components/
│   ├── public/assets/screens/  # Stitch screenshots
│   └── remotion.config.ts
├── screens.json                # Screen manifest
└── output.mp4                  # Final video
```

## How It Works

1. **Discovery**: Identifies Stitch and Remotion MCP servers
2. **Retrieval**: Fetches screens and metadata from Stitch project
3. **Asset Download**: Downloads screenshots for each screen
4. **Composition**: Generates Remotion React components
5. **Preview**: Opens Remotion Studio for refinement (optional)
6. **Render**: Produces final video file

## Integration Points

**With Stitch:**
- Uses Stitch MCP to list projects and screens
- Downloads screenshots and HTML code
- Extracts screen metadata (title, dimensions)

**With Remotion:**
- Creates TypeScript/React components
- Configures composition settings
- Renders video using Remotion CLI or MCP

## Advanced Capabilities

- **Dynamic text extraction**: Parse Stitch HTML to auto-generate annotations
- **Interactive hotspots**: Highlight clickable elements
- **Voiceover integration**: Sync narration with screen transitions
- **Multiple video patterns**: Slide show, feature highlight, user flow

# Stitch to Remotion Walkthrough Videos

You are a video production specialist focused on creating engaging walkthrough videos from app designs. You combine Stitch's screen retrieval capabilities with Remotion's programmatic video generation to produce smooth, professional presentations.

## Overview

This skill enables you to create walkthrough videos that showcase app screens with professional transitions, zoom effects, and contextual text overlays. The workflow retrieves screens from Stitch projects and orchestrates them into a Remotion video composition.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Access to the Stitch MCP Server
- Access to the Remotion MCP Server (or Remotion CLI)
- Node.js and npm installed
- A Stitch project with designed screens

**Recommended:**
- Familiarity with Remotion's video capabilities
- Understanding of React components (Remotion uses React)

## Retrieval and Networking

### Step 1: Discover Available MCP Servers

Run `list_tools` to identify available MCP servers and their prefixes:
- **Stitch MCP**: Look for `stitch:` or `mcp_stitch:` prefix
- **Remotion MCP**: Look for `remotion:` or `mcp_remotion:` prefix

### Step 2: Retrieve Stitch Project Information

1. **Project lookup** (if Project ID is not provided):
   - Call `[stitch_prefix]:list_projects` with `filter: "view=owned"`
   - Identify target project by title (e.g., "Calculator App")
   - Extract Project ID from `name` field (e.g., `projects/13534454087919359824`)

2. **Screen retrieval**:
   - Call `[stitch_prefix]:list_screens` with the project ID (numeric only)
   - Review screen titles to identify all screens for the walkthrough
   - Extract Screen IDs from each screen's `name` field

3. **Screen metadata fetch**:
   For each screen:
   - Call `[stitch_prefix]:get_screen` with `projectId` and `screenId`
   - Retrieve:
     - `screenshot.downloadUrl` — Visual asset for the video
     - `htmlCode.downloadUrl` — Optional: for extracting text/content
     - `width`, `height` — Screen dimensions for proper scaling
     - Screen title and description for text overlays

4. **Asset download**:
   - Use `web_fetch` or `Bash` with `curl` to download screenshots
   - Save to a staging directory: `assets/screens/{screen-name}.png`
   - Organize assets in order of the intended walkthrough flow

### Step 3: Set Up Remotion Project

1. **Check for existing Remotion project**:
   - Look for `remotion.config.ts` or `package.json` with Remotion dependencies
   - If exists, use the existing project structure

2. **Create new Remotion project** (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm create video@latest -- --blank
   ```
   - Choose TypeScript template
   - Set up in a dedicated `video/` directory

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd video
   npm install @remotion/transitions @remotion/animated-emoji
   ```

## Video Composition Strategy

### Architecture

Create a modular Remotion composition with these components:

1. **`ScreenSlide.tsx`** — Individual screen display component
   - Props: `imageSrc`, `title`, `description`, `width`, `height`
   - Features: Zoom-in animation, fade transitions
   - Duration: Configurable (default 3-5 seconds per screen)

2. **`WalkthroughComposition.tsx`** — Main video composition
   - Sequences multiple `ScreenSlide` components
   - Handles transitions between screens
   - Adds text overlays and annotations

3. **`config.ts`** — Video configuration
   - Frame rate (default: 30 fps)
   - Video dimensions (match Stitch screen dimensions or scale appropriately)
   - Total duration calculation

### Transition Effects

Use Remotion's `@remotion/transitions` for professional effects:

- **Fade**: Smooth cross-fade between screens
  ```tsx
  import {fade} from '@remotion/transitions/fade';
  ```

- **Slide**: Directional slide transitions
  ```tsx
  import {slide} from '@remotion/transitions/slide';
  ```

- **Zoom**: Zoom in/out effects for emphasis
  - Use `spring()` animation for smooth zoom
  - Apply to important UI elements

### Text Overlays

Add contextual information using Remotion's text rendering:

1. **Screen titles**: Display at the top or bottom of each frame
2. **Feature callouts**: Highlight specific UI elements with animated pointers
3. **Descriptions**: Fade in descriptive text for each screen
4. **Progress indicator**: Show current screen position in walkthrough

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather Screen Assets

1. Identify target Stitch project
2. List all screens in the project
3. Download screenshots for each screen
4. Organize in order of walkthrough flow
5. Create a manifest file (`screens.json`):

```json
{
  "projectName": "Calculator App",
  "screens": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Home Screen",
      "description": "Main calculator interface with number pad",
      "imagePath": "assets/screens/home.png",
      "width": 1200,
      "height": 800,
      "duration": 4
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "title": "History View",
      "description": "View of previous calculations",
      "imagePath": "assets/screens/history.png",
      "width": 1200,
      "height": 800,
      "duration": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Generate Remotion Components

Create the video components following Remotion best practices:

1. **Create `ScreenSlide.tsx`**:
   - Use `useCurrentFrame()` and `spring()` for animations
   - Implement zoom and fade effects
   - Add text overlays with proper timing

2. **Create `WalkthroughComposition.tsx`**:
   - Import screen manifest
   - Sequence screens with `<Sequence>` components
   - Apply transitions between screens
   - Calculate proper timing and offsets

3. **Update `remotion.config.ts`**:
   - Set composition ID
   - Configure video dimensions
   - Set frame rate and duration

**Reference Resources:**
- Use `resources/screen-slide-template.tsx` as starting point
- Follow `resources/composition-checklist.md` for completeness
- Review examples in `examples/walkthrough/` directory

### Step 3: Preview and Refine

1. **Start Remotion Studio**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Opens browser-based preview
   - Allows real-time editing and refinement

2. **Adjust timing**:
   - Ensure each screen has appropriate display duration
   - Verify transitions are smooth
   - Check text overlay timing

3. **Fine-tune animations**:
   - Adjust spring configurations for zoom effects
   - Modify easing functions for transitions
   - Ensure text is readable at all times

### Step 4: Render Video

1. **Render using Remotion CLI**:
   ```bash
   npx remotion render WalkthroughComposition output.mp4
   ```

2. **Alternative: Use Remotion MCP** (if available):
   - Call `[remotion_prefix]:render` with composition details
   - Specify output format (MP4, WebM, etc.)

3. **Optimization options**:
   - Set quality level (`--quality`)
   - Configure codec (`--codec h264` or `h265`)
   - Enable parallel rendering (`--concurrency`)

## Advanced Features

### Interactive Hotspots

Highlight clickable elements or important features:

```tsx
import {interpolate, useCurrentFrame} from 'remotion';

const Hotspot = ({x, y, label}) => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame();
  const scale = spring({
    frame,
    fps: 30,
    config: {damping: 10, stiffness: 100}
  });
  
  return (
    <div style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      left: x,
      top: y,
      transform: `scale(${scale})`
    }}>
      <div className="pulse-ring" />
      <span>{label}</span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Voiceover Integration

Add narration to the walkthrough:

1. Generate voiceover script from screen descriptions
2. Use text-to-speech or record audio
3. Import audio into Remotion with `<Audio>` component
4. Sync screen timing with voiceover pacing

### Dynamic Text Extraction

Extract text from Stitch HTML code for automatic annotations:

1. Download `htmlCode.downloadUrl` for each screen
2. Parse HTML to extract key text elements (headings, buttons, labels)
3. Generate automatic callouts for important UI elements
4. Add to composition as timed text overlays

## Integration with Remotion Skills

Remotion maintains its own Agent Skills that define best practices. Review these for advanced techniques:

- **Repository**: https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/tree/main/packages/skills
- **Installation**: `npx skills add remotion-dev/skills`

Key Remotion skills to leverage:
- Animation timing and easing
- Composition architecture patterns
- Performance optimization
- Audio synchronization

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Slide Show

Basic walkthrough with fade transitions:
- 3-5 seconds per screen
- Cross-fade transitions
- Bottom text overlay with screen title
- Progress bar at top

### Pattern 2: Feature Highlight

Focus on specific UI elements:
- Zoom into specific regions
- Animated circles/arrows pointing to features
- Slow-motion emphasis on key interactions
- Side-by-side before/after comparisons

### Pattern 3: User Flow

Show step-by-step user journey:
- Sequential screen flow with directional slides
- Numbered steps overlay
- Highlight user actions (clicks, taps)
- Connect screens with animated paths

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Blurry screenshots** | Ensure downloaded images are at full resolution; check `screenshot.downloadUrl` quality settings |
| **Misaligned text** | Verify screen dimensions match composition size; adjust text positioning based on actual screen size |
| **Choppy animations** | Increase frame rate to 60fps; use proper spring configurations with appropriate damping |
| **Remotion build fails** | Check Node version compatibility; ensure all dependencies are installed; review Remotion docs |
| **Timing feels off** | Adjust duration per screen in manifest; preview in Remotion Studio; test with actual users |

## Best Practices

1. **Maintain aspect ratio**: Use actual Stitch screen dimensions or scale proportionally
2. **Consistent timing**: Keep screen display duration consistent unless emphasizing specific screens
3. **Readable text**: Ensure sufficient contrast; use appropriate font sizes; avoid cluttered overlays
4. **Smooth transitions**: Use spring animations for natural motion; avoid jarring cuts
5. **Preview thoroughly**: Always preview in Remotion Studio before final render
6. **Optimize assets**: Compress images appropriately; use efficient formats (PNG for UI, JPG for photos)

## Example Usage

**User prompt:**
```
Look up the screens in my Stitch project "Calculator App" and build a remotion video 
that shows a walkthrough of the screens.
```

**Agent workflow:**
1. List Stitch projects → Find "Calculator App" → Extract project ID
2. List screens in project → Identify all screens (Home, History, Settings)
3. Download screenshots for each screen → Save to `assets/screens/`
4. Create `screens.json` manifest with screen metadata
5. Generate Remotion components (`ScreenSlide.tsx`, `WalkthroughComposition.tsx`)
6. Preview in Remotion Studio → Refine timing and transitions
7. Render final video → `calculator-walkthrough.mp4`
8. Report completion with video preview link

## Tips for Success

- **Start simple**: Begin with basic fade transitions before adding complex animations
- **Follow Remotion patterns**: Leverage Remotion's official skills and documentation
- **Use manifest files**: Keep screen data organized in JSON for easy updates
- **Preview frequently**: Use Remotion Studio to catch issues early
- **Consider accessibility**: Add captions; ensure text is readable; use clear visuals
- **Optimize for platform**: Match video dimensions to target platform (YouTube, social media, etc.)

/**
 * Key Patterns Demonstrated:
 * 
 * 1. Layout Composition: Centered authentication card with full-height viewport
 * 2. Card Usage: Structured content with header, body, and footer
 * 3. Tabs: Switch between login and register forms
 * 4. Form Structure: Proper labeling and input grouping
 * 5. Loading States: Button disabled state during form submission
 * 6. Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly with max-width constraint
 * 7. Tailwind Utilities: Using spacing, flexbox, and grid utilities
 * 
 * Design Choices:
 * - Minimal, clean interface focusing on the task at hand
 * - Proper semantic HTML with form elements
 * - Accessible labels and inputs
 * - Clear visual hierarchy with card components
 * - Loading feedback for better UX
 * 
 * Required Dependencies:
 * None beyond React and shadcn/ui components
 * 
 * Installation:

          render={({ field }) => (
            <FormItem>
              <FormLabel>Bio</FormLabel>
              <FormControl>
                <Textarea
                  placeholder="Tell us about yourself"
                  className="resize-none"
                  {...field}
                />

              <FormDescription>
                Optional. Maximum 160 characters.
              </FormDescription>
              <FormMessage />

# shadcn/ui Customization Guide

Learn how to customize shadcn/ui components to match your brand and design requirements.

## Theming Approach

shadcn/ui uses a CSS variable-based theming system, making it easy to customize colors, spacing, and other design tokens globally.

## Color Customization

### Understanding the Color System

shadcn/ui uses HSL color values stored as CSS variables. Each color has a base value and a foreground variant for text/content that appears on top of it.

**Base Color Variables** (in `globals.css`):
```css
:root {
  --background: 0 0% 100%;        /* Page background */
  --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;   /* Primary text color */
  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;   /* Primary brand color */
  --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%; /* Text on primary */
  --secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;     /* Secondary actions */
  --accent: 210 40% 96.1%;        /* Accent highlights */
  --muted: 210 40% 96.1%;         /* Muted backgrounds */
  --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;   /* Error/danger */
  --border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;    /* Border colors */
  --input: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;     /* Input borders */
  --ring: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;      /* Focus rings */
}
```

### Changing Brand Colors

To match your brand, update the primary color:

```css
:root {
  /* Original blue */
  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;
  
  /* Change to brand purple */
  --primary: 270 91% 65%;
  
  /* Adjust foreground for contrast */
  --primary-foreground: 0 0% 100%;
}
```

**HSL Format**: `hue saturation lightness`
- Hue: 0-360 (color wheel position)
- Saturation: 0-100% (color intensity)
- Lightness: 0-100% (brightness)

### Tools for Color Selection

1. **HSL Color Picker**: https://hslpicker.com/
2. **Shadcn Theme Generator**: https://ui.shadcn.com/themes
3. **Coolors**: https://coolors.co/ (generates palettes)

### Creating a Color Scheme

Start with your primary brand color, then derive other colors:

```css
:root {
  /* 1. Primary brand color */
  --primary: 230 90% 60%;
  --primary-foreground: 0 0% 100%;
  
  /* 2. Lighter variant for secondary */
  --secondary: 230 30% 95%;
  --secondary-foreground: 230 90% 30%;
  
  /* 3. Subtle accent (shift hue slightly) */
  --accent: 200 90% 60%;
  --accent-foreground: 0 0% 100%;
  
  /* 4. Muted backgrounds (low saturation) */
  --muted: 230 20% 96%;
  --muted-foreground: 230 20% 40%;
  
  /* 5. Keep destructive red-based */
  --destructive: 0 84% 60%;
  --destructive-foreground: 0 0% 100%;
}
```

## Dark Mode

### Setting Up Dark Mode

shadcn/ui includes dark mode support out of the box. Add dark mode colors:

```css
.dark {
  --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
  --foreground: 210 40% 98%;
  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;
  --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
  /* ... all color variables */
}
```

### Toggle Dark Mode

**Next.js with next-themes**:
```bash
npm install next-themes
```

```tsx
// app/providers.tsx
"use client"

import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes"

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="system" enableSystem>
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

// app/layout.tsx
import { Providers } from "./providers"

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body>
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}

// components/theme-toggle.tsx
"use client"

import { Moon, Sun } from "lucide-react"
import { useTheme } from "next-themes"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export function ThemeToggle() {
  const { setTheme, theme } = useTheme()

  return (
    <Button
      variant="ghost"
      size="icon"
      onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}
    >
      <Sun className="h-5 w-5 rotate-0 scale-100 transition-all dark:-rotate-90 dark:scale-0" />
      <Moon className="absolute h-5 w-5 rotate-90 scale-0 transition-all dark:rotate-0 dark:scale-100" />
      <span className="sr-only">Toggle theme</span>
    </Button>
  )
}
```

## Component Customization

### Using Variants

shadcn/ui components use `class-variance-authority` (cva) for variants. Example from Button:

```typescript
// components/ui/button.tsx
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"

const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90",
        destructive: "bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90",
        outline: "border border-input bg-background hover:bg-accent",
        ghost: "hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
        link: "text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline",
      },
      size: {
        default: "h-10 px-4 py-2",
        sm: "h-9 rounded-md px-3",
        lg: "h-11 rounded-md px-8",
        icon: "h-10 w-10",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
)
```

### Adding Custom Variants

To add a new variant, edit the component file in `components/ui/`:

```typescript
// Add new "success" variant to button
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "...",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "...",
        destructive: "...",
        // Add new variant
        success: "bg-green-600 text-white hover:bg-green-700",
      },
      // Add new size
      size: {
        default: "...",
        xl: "h-12 rounded-md px-10 text-base",
      },
    },
  }
)

// Update TypeScript interface
export interface ButtonProps
  extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>,
    VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {
  asChild?: boolean
}
```

Usage:
```tsx
<Button variant="success" size="xl">Save Changes</Button>
```

### Creating Composite Components

Don't modify `components/ui/` directly. Instead, create wrapper components:

```tsx
// components/loading-button.tsx
import { Button, ButtonProps } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Loader2 } from "lucide-react"

interface LoadingButtonProps extends ButtonProps {
  loading?: boolean
}

export function LoadingButton({ 
  loading, 
  children, 
  disabled,
  ...props 
}: LoadingButtonProps) {
  return (
    <Button disabled={loading || disabled} {...props}>
      {loading && <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />}
      {children}
    </Button>
  )
}
```

## Typography Customization

### Font Family

Update `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
        heading: ['Poppins', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
        mono: ['Fira Code', 'monospace'],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Import fonts in your layout:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Inter, Poppins } from 'next/font/google'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'], variable: '--font-sans' })
const poppins = Poppins({ 
  weight: ['600', '700'], 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  variable: '--font-heading',
})

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html className={`${inter.variable} ${poppins.variable}`}>
      <body className="font-sans">{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Use in components:
```tsx
<h1 className="font-heading text-3xl">Heading</h1>
<p className="font-sans">Body text</p>
```

### Font Sizes

Extend Tailwind's font scale:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontSize: {
        'xs': '0.75rem',     // 12px
        'sm': '0.875rem',    // 14px
        'base': '1rem',      // 16px
        'lg': '1.125rem',    // 18px
        'xl': '1.25rem',     // 20px
        '2xl': '1.5rem',     // 24px
        '3xl': '1.875rem',   // 30px
        '4xl': '2.25rem',    // 36px
        '5xl': '3rem',       // 48px
        '6xl': '3.75rem',    // 60px
        '7xl': '4.5rem',     // 72px
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Spacing & Layout

### Border Radius

Customize roundedness globally:

```css
/* globals.css */
:root {
  --radius: 0.5rem;  /* Default (8px) */
  
  /* More rounded */
  --radius: 1rem;    /* 16px */
  
  /* Sharp edges */
  --radius: 0;       /* No rounding */
  
  /* Very rounded */
  --radius: 1.5rem;  /* 24px */
}
```

This affects all components using `rounded-lg`, `rounded-md`, `rounded-sm`.

### Custom Spacing

Extend Tailwind's spacing scale:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      spacing: {
        '72': '18rem',
        '84': '21rem',
        '96': '24rem',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Animation Customization

### Adjusting Existing Animations

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      keyframes: {
        // Make accordion faster
        "accordion-down": {
          from: { height: 0 },
          to: { height: "var(--radix-accordion-content-height)" },
        },
        "accordion-up": {
          from: { height: "var(--radix-accordion-content-height)" },
          to: { height: 0 },
        },
      },
      animation: {
        "accordion-down": "accordion-down 0.15s ease-out", // Faster
        "accordion-up": "accordion-up 0.15s ease-out",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Adding New Animations

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      keyframes: {
        "fade-in": {
          "0%": { opacity: 0 },
          "100%": { opacity: 1 },
        },
        "slide-in-bottom": {
          "0%": { transform: "translateY(100%)" },
          "100%": { transform: "translateY(0)" },
        },
      },
      animation: {
        "fade-in": "fade-in 0.3s ease-out",
        "slide-in-bottom": "slide-in-bottom 0.3s ease-out",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Use in components:
```tsx
<div className="animate-fade-in">Content</div>
```

## Advanced Customization

### Creating a Design System

Structure your customizations:

```
src/
├── styles/
│   ├── globals.css          # CSS variables & base styles
│   ├── themes/
│   │   ├── default.css      # Default theme
│   │   └── brand.css        # Brand-specific overrides
│   └── components/
│       └── custom.css       # Component-specific styles
├── lib/
│   └── design-tokens.ts     # Shared constants
└── components/
    ├── ui/                  # shadcn components (don't modify)
    └── custom/              # Your wrapper components
```

### Design Tokens File

```typescript
// lib/design-tokens.ts
export const designTokens = {
  colors: {
    brand: {
      primary: 'hsl(230, 90%, 60%)',
      secondary: 'hsl(230, 30%, 95%)',
    },
  },
  spacing: {
    section: '5rem',
    card: '1.5rem',
  },
  radius: {
    card: '1rem',
    button: '0.5rem',
  },
  typography: {
    h1: 'text-5xl font-heading font-bold',
    h2: 'text-4xl font-heading font-semibold',
    h3: 'text-3xl font-heading font-semibold',
    body: 'text-base font-sans',
    small: 'text-sm text-muted-foreground',
  },
} as const
```

Use in components:
```tsx
import { designTokens } from "@/lib/design-tokens"

<h1 className={designTokens.typography.h1}>Title</h1>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Don't modify `components/ui/` files directly**: Create wrapper components instead
2. **Use CSS variables for theming**: Easier to maintain and switch themes
3. **Leverage Tailwind's `extend`**: Don't replace defaults, extend them
4. **Keep variants in component files**: Co-locate variant logic with components
5. **Test dark mode**: Ensure all customizations work in both themes
6. **Document custom variants**: Add comments for custom additions
7. **Use consistent spacing**: Stick to Tailwind's spacing scale
8. **Maintain accessibility**: Don't sacrifice contrast for aesthetics

# Migration Guide to shadcn/ui

This guide helps you migrate from other UI libraries to shadcn/ui.

## Why Migrate to shadcn/ui?

- **Full ownership**: Code lives in your project, not node_modules
- **Customizable**: Modify any component to fit your needs
- **No breaking changes**: Update components individually
- **Smaller bundles**: Only include what you use
- **Modern stack**: Built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support

## Migration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Incremental Migration (Recommended)

Gradually replace components over time:

1. Install shadcn/ui alongside existing library
2. Replace components page by page or feature by feature
3. Remove old library once migration is complete

**Pros**: Low risk, can be done alongside feature work
**Cons**: Temporary bundle size increase

### Strategy 2: Big Bang Migration

Replace all components at once:

1. Set up shadcn/ui
2. Create component mapping document
3. Replace all components in one effort
4. Test thoroughly

**Pros**: Clean cutover, no mixed UI
**Cons**: High risk, requires dedicated time

## Internal Migrations (shadcn specific)

### RTL Support Migration
If you need to support RTL languages (like Arabic or Hebrew) in an existing shadcn/ui project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest migrate rtl
```

This CLI command transforms your components to use **logical properties**:
- `ml-4` -> `ms-4` (margin-start)
- `pl-4` -> `ps-4` (padding-start)
- `text-left` -> `text-start`

It ensures your UI adapts correctly to layout direction without manual refactoring.

## From Material-UI (MUI)

### Component Mapping

| MUI Component | shadcn/ui Equivalent | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| Button | Button | Similar API |
| TextField | Input + Label | Separate components |
| Select | Select | Different structure |
| Dialog | Dialog | Similar concept |
| Drawer | Sheet | Side panel |
| Card | Card | Very similar |
| Table | Table | Use with TanStack Table |
| Checkbox | Checkbox | Similar API |
| Switch | Switch | Similar API |
| Tabs | Tabs | Similar structure |
| Tooltip | Tooltip | Simpler API |
| Menu | Dropdown Menu | Different trigger model |
| Snackbar | Toast | Different implementation |
| Autocomplete | Combobox | Use with Command |

### Key Differences

**1. Import Structure**
```tsx
// MUI
import Button from '@mui/material/Button'

// shadcn/ui
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
```

**2. Form Components**
```tsx
// MUI
<TextField
  label="Email"
  value={email}
  onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
  error={!!errors.email}
  helperText={errors.email}
/>

// shadcn/ui
<div className="space-y-2">
  <Label htmlFor="email">Email</Label>
  <Input
    id="email"
    value={email}
    onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
  />
  {errors.email && (
    <p className="text-sm text-destructive">{errors.email}</p>
  )}
</div>

// Or with Form component
<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="email"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>Email</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <Input {...field} />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```

**3. Theming**
```tsx
// MUI
import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles'

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: { main: '#1976d2' },
  },
})

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>

// shadcn/ui
// Edit globals.css
:root {
  --primary: 215 100% 50%;
}
```

**4. Styling Approach**
```tsx
// MUI (sx prop)
<Button sx={{ px: 4, py: 2, borderRadius: 2 }}>
  Click me
</Button>

// shadcn/ui (Tailwind classes)
<Button className="px-4 py-2 rounded-lg">
  Click me
</Button>
```

### Migration Example: Login Form

**Before (MUI)**:
```tsx
import { TextField, Button, Box } from '@mui/material'

export function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <Box component="form" sx={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: 2 }}>
      <TextField label="Email" type="email" required />
      <TextField label="Password" type="password" required />
      <Button variant="contained" type="submit">
        Sign In
      </Button>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

**After (shadcn/ui)**:
```tsx
import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input'
import { Label } from '@/components/ui/label'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

export function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <form className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <Label htmlFor="email">Email</Label>
        <Input id="email" type="email" required />
      </div>
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <Label htmlFor="password">Password</Label>
        <Input id="password" type="password" required />
      </div>
      <Button type="submit">Sign In</Button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## From Chakra UI

### Component Mapping

| Chakra UI | shadcn/ui | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Button | Button | Similar variants |
| Input | Input | More basic |
| Select | Select | Different structure |
| Modal | Dialog | Similar concept |
| Drawer | Sheet | Very similar |
| Box | div | Use Tailwind classes |
| Flex | div | Use flex utilities |
| Stack | div | Use space-y-* classes |
| Text | p/span | Use typography classes |
| Heading | h1/h2/etc | Use typography classes |
| useToast | useToast | Different API |
| Menu | Dropdown Menu | Similar |

### Key Differences

**1. Layout Components**
```tsx
// Chakra UI
<Stack spacing={4} direction="column">
  <Box>Item 1</Box>
  <Box>Item 2</Box>
</Stack>

// shadcn/ui
<div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
</div>
```

**2. Responsive Styles**
```tsx
// Chakra UI
<Box display={{ base: 'block', md: 'flex' }} />

// shadcn/ui
<div className="block md:flex" />
```

**3. Color Mode**
```tsx
// Chakra UI
import { useColorMode } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const { colorMode, toggleColorMode } = useColorMode()

// shadcn/ui (with next-themes)
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes'

const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()
```

## From Ant Design

### Component Mapping

| Ant Design | shadcn/ui | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| Button | Button | Similar |
| Input | Input | More basic |
| Form | Form | Different approach |
| Table | Table | Use TanStack Table |
| Modal | Dialog | Similar |
| Drawer | Sheet | Similar |
| Select | Select | Different API |
| DatePicker | Calendar + Popover | More manual |
| Menu | Navigation Menu | Different |
| message | Toast | Different API |
| notification | Toast | Similar concept |

### Key Differences

**1. Form Handling**
```tsx
// Ant Design
<Form
  form={form}
  onFinish={onSubmit}
>
  <Form.Item name="email" rules={[{ required: true }]}>
    <Input />
  </Form.Item>
  <Form.Item>
    <Button type="primary" htmlType="submit">Submit</Button>
  </Form.Item>
</Form>

// shadcn/ui (with react-hook-form)
<Form {...form}>
  <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
    <FormField
      control={form.control}
      name="email"
      render={({ field }) => (
        <FormItem>
          <FormControl>
            <Input {...field} />
          </FormControl>
          <FormMessage />
        </FormItem>
      )}
    />
    <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
  </form>
</Form>
```

**2. Notifications**
```tsx
// Ant Design
import { message } from 'antd'

message.success('Success!')

// shadcn/ui
import { useToast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast'

const { toast } = useToast()

toast({
  title: "Success!",
  description: "Operation completed.",
})
```

## From Bootstrap

### Component Mapping

| Bootstrap | shadcn/ui | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| btn | Button | Similar variants |
| form-control | Input | Similar |
| card | Card | Very similar structure |
| modal | Dialog | Different API |
| dropdown | Dropdown Menu | Similar concept |
| nav/navbar | Navigation Menu | Different |
| alert | Alert | Similar |
| badge | Badge | Similar |
| table | Table | Use with TanStack Table |

### Key Differences

**1. Class-Based vs Component-Based**
```tsx
// Bootstrap
<button className="btn btn-primary btn-lg">
  Click me
</button>

// shadcn/ui
<Button variant="default" size="lg">
  Click me
</Button>
```

**2. Cards**
```html
<!-- Bootstrap -->
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-header">Title</div>
  <div class="card-body">Content</div>
  <div class="card-footer">Footer</div>
</div>

<!-- shadcn/ui -->
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Title</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>Content</CardContent>
  <CardFooter>Footer</CardFooter>
</Card>
```

## Migration Checklist

### Before Migration

- [ ] Audit current component usage
- [ ] Set up shadcn/ui in a test branch
- [ ] Create component mapping document
- [ ] Plan migration order (start with simple components)
- [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS properly
- [ ] Configure path aliases

### During Migration

- [ ] Install shadcn/ui components as needed
- [ ] Replace components incrementally
- [ ] Update styling to use Tailwind classes
- [ ] Test each page/feature after migration
- [ ] Update tests to match new components
- [ ] Handle form validation (switch to react-hook-form + zod)
- [ ] Migrate theme/color variables

### After Migration

- [ ] Remove old UI library dependencies
- [ ] Clean up unused imports
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Review and update design system
- [ ] Train team on new components

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Not Setting Up Tailwind Properly

shadcn/ui requires Tailwind. Ensure:
- `tailwind.config.js` includes correct content paths
- CSS variables are defined in `globals.css`
- Tailwind plugins are installed (e.g., `tailwindcss-animate`)

### 2. Forgetting Path Aliases

Components use `@/` imports. Configure:
- `tsconfig.json` with path aliases
- Vite/Next.js config for runtime resolution

### 3. Trying to Match Old Library Exactly

Don't force shadcn/ui to work like your old library. Embrace the new patterns:
- Use composition over configuration
- Leverage Tailwind utilities
- Create wrapper components for custom needs

### 4. Not Using Form Libraries

shadcn/ui form components are basic. For complex forms, use:
- `react-hook-form` for form state
- `zod` for validation
- shadcn's `Form` component for integration

### 5. Ignoring Accessibility

While shadcn/ui is accessible by default, custom modifications can break this. Test with:
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen readers
- ARIA attribute validation

## Getting Help

- **Discord**: [shadcn/ui Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vNvTqVaWm6)
- **GitHub Discussions**: [shadcn/ui Discussions](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/discussions)
- **Documentation**: [ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com)

## Next Steps

After migration:
1. Review the [Customization Guide](./customization-guide.md)
2. Explore the [Component Catalog](./component-catalog.md)
3. Check out [Examples](../examples/)
4. Consider building a component library on top of shadcn/ui

## File: shadcn-ui/resources/setup-guide.md
````markdown
# shadcn/ui Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up shadcn/ui in both new and existing projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **Node.js 18+** installed
- **React 18+** in your project
- **Tailwind CSS 3.0+** configured
- A package manager: npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

## Quick Start (New Project)

### Option 1: npx shadcn create (Recommended)

The easiest way to start a new project with shadcn/ui is using the `create` command, which allows you to customize everything (framework, library, style, font, etc.).

```bash
npx shadcn@latest create
```

This interactive command will guide you through:
1.  **Project Name**: Directory for your app.
2.  **Visual Style**: Choose from Vega, Nova, Maia, Lyra, Mira, or Classic.
3.  **Base Color**: Select your primary theme color.
4.  **Framework**: Next.js, Vite, Laravel, etc.
5.  **Component Library**: Choose **Radix UI** or **Base UI**.
6.  **RTL Support**: Enable Right-to-Left support if needed.

### Option 2: Classic Manual Setup (Next.js)

```bash
# Create a new Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app

# Initialize shadcn/ui
npx shadcn@latest init

# Add your first component
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

### Option 3: Classic Manual Setup (Vite + React)

```bash
# Create a new Vite project
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-app
npm install

# Install Tailwind CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

# Initialize shadcn/ui
npx shadcn@latest init

# Add your first component
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Existing Project Setup

### Step 1: Ensure Tailwind CSS is Installed

If Tailwind is not installed:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Configure `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### Step 2: Initialize shadcn/ui

Run the initialization command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

You'll be asked to configure:

1. **Style**: Choose between `default`, `new-york`, or one of the new styles (Vega, Nova, etc.)
   - `default`: Clean and minimal design
   - `new-york`: More refined with subtle details

2. **Base Color**: Choose your primary color palette
   - slate, gray, zinc, neutral, or stone

3. **CSS Variables**: Recommend `yes` for easier theming

4. **TypeScript**: Recommend `yes` for type safety

5. **Import Alias**: Default is `@/components` (recommended)

6. **React Server Components**: Choose based on your framework
   - `yes` for Next.js 13+ with app directory
   - `no` for Vite, CRA, or Next.js pages directory

7. **RTL Support**: Answer `yes` if you need Right-to-Left layout support (this will use logical properties like `ms-4` instead of `ml-4`).

## Advanced Features

### Visual Styles
shadcn/ui now offers multiple visual styles beyond the defaults:
- **Vega**: The classic shadcn/ui look.
- **Nova**: Reduced padding/margins, compact.
- **Maia**: Soft, rounded, generous spacing.
- **Lyra**: Boxy, sharp, mono font friendly.
- **Mira**: Dense, compact.

### Base UI Support
You can now choose between **Radix UI** and **Base UI** as the underlying primitive library. They share the same component API/abstraction, so your usage remains consistent.


### Step 3: Verify Configuration

The init command creates/updates several files:

**components.json** (root of project):
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "default",
  "rsc": false,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js",
    "css": "src/index.css",
    "baseColor": "slate",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib"
  }
}
```

**src/lib/utils.ts**:
```typescript
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```

**Updated tailwind.config.js**:
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  darkMode: ["class"],
  content: [
    './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    container: {
      center: true,
      padding: "2rem",
      screens: {
        "2xl": "1400px",
      },
    },
    extend: {
      colors: {
        border: "hsl(var(--border))",
        input: "hsl(var(--input))",
        ring: "hsl(var(--ring))",
        background: "hsl(var(--background))",
        foreground: "hsl(var(--foreground))",
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: "hsl(var(--primary))",
          foreground: "hsl(var(--primary-foreground))",
        },
        // ... more colors
      },
      borderRadius: {
        lg: "var(--radius)",
        md: "calc(var(--radius) - 2px)",
        sm: "calc(var(--radius) - 4px)",
      },
      keyframes: {
        "accordion-down": {
          from: { height: 0 },
          to: { height: "var(--radix-accordion-content-height)" },
        },
        "accordion-up": {
          from: { height: "var(--radix-accordion-content-height)" },
          to: { height: 0 },
        },
      },
      animation: {
        "accordion-down": "accordion-down 0.2s ease-out",
        "accordion-up": "accordion-up 0.2s ease-out",
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [require("tailwindcss-animate")],
}
```

**Updated globals.css** (or equivalent):
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  :root {
    --background: 0 0% 100%;
    --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --card: 0 0% 100%;
    --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --popover: 0 0% 100%;
    --popover-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;
    --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;
    --secondary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
    --muted: 210 40% 96.1%;
    --muted-foreground: 215.4 16.3% 46.9%;
    --accent: 210 40% 96.1%;
    --accent-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
    --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;
    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;
    --input: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;
    --ring: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;
    --radius: 0.5rem;
  }

  .dark {
    --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    /* ... dark mode variables */
  }
}

@layer base {
  * {
    @apply border-border;
  }
  body {
    @apply bg-background text-foreground;
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Configure Path Aliases

Ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes path aliases:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

For Vite, also update `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
import path from "path"
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react"

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
})
```

### Step 5: Add Components

Now you can add components:

```bash
# Add individual components
npx shadcn@latest add button
npx shadcn@latest add card
npx shadcn@latest add dialog

# Add multiple components at once
npx shadcn@latest add button card dialog input label
```

Components will be added to `src/components/ui/` by default.

## Framework-Specific Considerations

### Next.js App Router

- Set `rsc: true` in `components.json`
- Add `"use client"` to stateful components
- Import components work from server components by default

### Next.js Pages Router

- Set `rsc: false` in `components.json`
- All components are client-side by default

### Vite

- Ensure path aliases are configured in `vite.config.ts`
- Import `globals.css` in your main entry point (`main.tsx`)

### Create React App

- Use `craco` or `react-app-rewired` for path alias support
- Or use relative imports instead of aliases

## Verification Steps

1. **Check file structure**:
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   │   └── ui/
   ├── lib/
   │   └── utils.ts
   └── index.css (or globals.css)
   ```

2. **Test a simple component**:
   ```tsx
   import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
   
   export default function App() {
     return <Button>Click me</Button>
   }
   ```

3. **Verify Tailwind is working**:
   - Component should render with proper styling
   - Check browser dev tools for applied classes

4. **Test dark mode** (if using CSS variables):
   ```tsx
   <html className="dark">
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module '@/components/ui/button'"

**Solution**: Check path alias configuration in `tsconfig.json` and framework config.

### Styles not applying

**Solution**: 
- Ensure `globals.css` is imported in your app entry point
- Verify Tailwind config `content` paths include your files
- Check CSS variables are defined in `globals.css`

### TypeScript errors in components

**Solution**:
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that `@types/react` is installed
- Restart TypeScript server in your editor

### Components look broken

**Solution**:
- Verify `tailwindcss-animate` is installed: `npm install tailwindcss-animate`
- Check that CSS variables are properly defined
- Ensure you're not overriding component styles globally

## Next Steps

1. Browse the [component catalog](./component-catalog.md)
2. Read the [customization guide](./customization-guide.md)
3. Check out example implementations in `/examples`
4. Join the [shadcn/ui Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vNvTqVaWm6)

```

## How It Works

When activated, the agent follows this workflow:

### 1. **Discovery & Planning**
- Lists available components using shadcn MCP tools
- Identifies required dependencies
- Plans component composition strategy

### 2. **Setup & Configuration**
- Verifies or initializes `components.json`
- Checks Tailwind CSS configuration
- Validates import aliases and paths

### 3. **Component Integration**
- Retrieves component source code
- Installs via CLI or manual integration
- Handles dependency installation

### 4. **Customization**
- Applies theme customization
- Creates component variants
- Extends components with custom logic

### 5. **Quality Assurance**
- Validates TypeScript types
- Checks accessibility compliance
- Verifies responsive behavior

## Prerequisites

Your project should have:
- **React 18+**
- **Tailwind CSS 3.0+**
- **TypeScript** (recommended)
- **Node.js 18+**

## Quick Start

### For New Projects

```bash
# Create Next.js project with shadcn/ui
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npx shadcn@latest init

# Add components
npx shadcn@latest add button
npx shadcn@latest add card
```

### For Existing Projects

```bash
# Initialize shadcn/ui
npx shadcn@latest init

# Configure when prompted:
# - Choose style (default/new-york)
# - Select base color
# - Configure CSS variables
# - Set import aliases

# Add your first component
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Available Components

shadcn/ui provides 50+ components including:

**Layout**: Accordion, Card, Separator, Tabs, Collapsible  
**Forms**: Button, Input, Label, Checkbox, Radio Group, Select, Textarea  
**Data Display**: Table, Badge, Avatar, Progress, Skeleton  
**Overlays**: Dialog, Sheet, Popover, Tooltip, Dropdown Menu  
**Navigation**: Navigation Menu, Tabs, Breadcrumb, Pagination  
**Feedback**: Alert, Alert Dialog, Toast, Command  

Plus complete **Blocks** like:
- Authentication forms
- Dashboard layouts
- Calendar interfaces
- Sidebar navigation
- E-commerce components

## Customization Approach

### Theme-Level Customization
Modify CSS variables in `globals.css`:
```css
:root {
  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;
  --secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;
  /* ... */
}
```

### Component-Level Customization
Components use `class-variance-authority` for variants:
```typescript
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "base-classes",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: { default: "...", destructive: "..." },
      size: { default: "...", sm: "..." },
    }
  }
)
```

### Composition
Create higher-level components:
```typescript
// Compose existing components
export function FeatureCard({ title, description, icon }) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        {icon}
        <CardTitle>{title}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <p>{description}</p>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

## Integration with MCP Tools

This skill leverages shadcn MCP server capabilities:

- `list_components` - Browse component catalog
- `get_component` - Retrieve component source
- `get_component_metadata` - View props and dependencies
- `get_component_demo` - See usage examples
- `list_blocks` - Browse UI blocks
- `get_block` - Retrieve block source with all files
- `search_items_in_registries` - Find components in custom registries

## Best Practices

1. **Keep `ui/` pure**: Don't modify components in `components/ui/` directly
2. **Compose, don't fork**: Create wrapper components instead of editing originals
3. **Use the CLI**: Let `shadcn add` handle dependencies and updates
4. **Maintain consistency**: Use the `cn()` utility for all class merging
5. **Respect accessibility**: Preserve ARIA attributes and keyboard handlers
6. **Test responsiveness**: shadcn components are responsive by default—keep it that way

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
Check your `tsconfig.json` includes path aliases:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Styles not applying
- Import `globals.css` in your root layout
- Verify Tailwind config includes component paths
- Check CSS variable definitions match component expectations

### TypeScript errors
- Ensure all Radix UI peer dependencies are installed
- Run `npm install` after adding components via CLI
- Check that React types are up to date

# shadcn/ui Component Integration

You are a frontend engineer specialized in building applications with shadcn/ui—a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable components built with Radix UI or Base UI and Tailwind CSS. You help developers discover, integrate, and customize components following best practices.

## Core Principles

shadcn/ui is **not a component library**—it's a collection of reusable components that you copy into your project. This gives you:
- **Full ownership**: Components live in your codebase, not node_modules
- **Complete customization**: Modify styling, behavior, and structure freely, including choosing between Radix UI or Base UI primitives
- **No version lock-in**: Update components selectively at your own pace
- **Zero runtime overhead**: No library bundle, just the code you need

## Component Discovery and Installation

### 1. Browse Available Components

Use the shadcn MCP tools to explore the component catalog and Registry Directory:
- **List all components**: Use `list_components` to see the complete catalog
- **Get component metadata**: Use `get_component_metadata` to understand props, dependencies, and usage
- **View component demos**: Use `get_component_demo` to see implementation examples

### 2. Component Installation

There are two approaches to adding components:

**A. Direct Installation (Recommended)**
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

This command:
- Downloads the component source code (adapting to your config: Radix vs Base UI)
- Installs required dependencies
- Places files in `components/ui/`
- Updates your `components.json` config

**B. Manual Integration**
1. Use `get_component` to retrieve the source code
2. Create the file in `components/ui/[component-name].tsx`
3. Install peer dependencies manually
4. Adjust imports if needed

### 3. Registry and Custom Registries

If working with a custom registry (defined in `components.json`) or exploring the Registry Directory:
- Use `get_project_registries` to list available registries
- Use `list_items_in_registries` to see registry-specific components
- Use `view_items_in_registries` for detailed component information
- Use `search_items_in_registries` to find specific components

## Project Setup

### Initial Configuration

For **new projects**, use the `create` command to customize everything (style, fonts, component library):

```bash
npx shadcn@latest create
```

For **existing projects**, initialize configuration:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

This creates `components.json` with your configuration:
- **style**: default, new-york (classic) OR choose new visual styles like Vega, Nova, Maia, Lyra, Mira
- **baseColor**: slate, gray, zinc, neutral, stone
- **cssVariables**: true/false for CSS variable usage
- **tailwind config**: paths to Tailwind files
- **aliases**: import path shortcuts
- **rsc**: Use React Server Components (yes/no)
- **rtl**: Enable RTL support (optional)

### Required Dependencies

shadcn/ui components require:
- **React** (18+)
- **Tailwind CSS** (3.0+)
- **Primitives**: Radix UI OR Base UI (depending on your choice)
- **class-variance-authority** (for variant styling)
- **clsx** and **tailwind-merge** (for class composition)

## Component Architecture

### File Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/              # shadcn components
│   │   ├── button.tsx
│   │   ├── card.tsx
│   │   └── dialog.tsx
│   └── [custom]/        # your composed components
│       └── user-card.tsx
├── lib/
│   └── utils.ts         # cn() utility
└── app/
    └── page.tsx
```

### The `cn()` Utility

All shadcn components use the `cn()` helper for class merging:

```typescript
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```

This allows you to:
- Override default styles without conflicts
- Conditionally apply classes
- Merge Tailwind classes intelligently

## Customization Best Practices

### 1. Theme Customization

Edit your Tailwind config and CSS variables in `app/globals.css`:

```css
@layer base {
  :root {
    --background: 0 0% 100%;
    --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;
    /* ... more variables */
  }
  
  .dark {
    --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    /* ... dark mode overrides */
  }
}
```

### 2. Component Variants

Use `class-variance-authority` (cva) for variant logic:

```typescript
import { cva } from "class-variance-authority"

const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground",
        outline: "border border-input",
      },
      size: {
        default: "h-10 px-4 py-2",
        sm: "h-9 rounded-md px-3",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
)
```

### 3. Extending Components

Create wrapper components in `components/` (not `components/ui/`):

```typescript
// components/custom-button.tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Loader2 } from "lucide-react"

export function LoadingButton({ 
  loading, 
  children, 
  ...props 
}: ButtonProps & { loading?: boolean }) {
  return (
    <Button disabled={loading} {...props}>
      {loading && <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />}
      {children}
    </Button>
  )
}
```

## Blocks and Complex Components

shadcn/ui provides complete UI blocks (authentication forms, dashboards, etc.):

1. **List available blocks**: Use `list_blocks` with optional category filter
2. **Get block source**: Use `get_block` with the block name
3. **Install blocks**: Many blocks include multiple component files

Blocks are organized by category:
- **calendar**: Calendar interfaces
- **dashboard**: Dashboard layouts
- **login**: Authentication flows
- **sidebar**: Navigation sidebars
- **products**: E-commerce components

## Accessibility

All shadcn/ui components are built on Radix UI primitives, ensuring:
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard support out of the box
- **Screen reader support**: Proper ARIA attributes
- **Focus management**: Logical focus flow
- **Disabled states**: Proper disabled and aria-disabled handling

When customizing, maintain accessibility:
- Keep ARIA attributes
- Preserve keyboard handlers
- Test with screen readers
- Maintain focus indicators

## Common Patterns

### Form Building
```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label"

// Use with react-hook-form for validation
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
```

### Dialog/Modal Patterns
```typescript
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogContent,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dialog"
```

### Data Display
```typescript
import {
  Table,
  TableBody,
  TableCell,
  TableHead,
  TableHeader,
  TableRow,
} from "@/components/ui/table"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
- Check `components.json` for correct alias configuration
- Verify `tsconfig.json` includes the `@` path alias:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "paths": {
        "@/*": ["./src/*"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Style Conflicts
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Check that `globals.css` is imported in your root layout
- Verify CSS variable names match between components and theme

### Missing Dependencies
- Run component installation via CLI to auto-install deps
- Manually check `package.json` for required Radix UI packages
- Use `get_component_metadata` to see dependency lists

### Version Compatibility
- shadcn/ui v4 requires React 18+ and Next.js 13+ (if using Next.js)
- Some components require specific Radix UI versions
- Check documentation for breaking changes between versions

## Validation and Quality

Before committing components:
1. **Type check**: Run `tsc --noEmit` to verify TypeScript
2. **Lint**: Run your linter to catch style issues
3. **Test accessibility**: Use tools like axe DevTools
4. **Visual QA**: Test in light and dark modes
5. **Responsive check**: Verify behavior at different breakpoints

# Example: Prompt Enhancement

## User Input (Vague)
> "Make a landing page for my fitness app called 'Pulse'. Use red and black. It should have a place for features and a hero section."

---

## Enhanced Prompt (Stitch-Optimized)
**Overall Purpose**: A high-energy, modern landing page for 'Pulse', a fitness tracking application. The vibe is powerful, motivating, and high-performance.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
- **Primary Color**: Racing Red (#e11d48) for CTA buttons and active states.
- **Secondary Color**: Deep Obsidian (#0f172a) for background and text containers.
- **Typography**: Bold, condensed sans-serif headings (e.g., Impact or Inter Tight) to convey speed and strength.
- **Style**: Hard edges with sharp, minimal borders; high contrast; dark mode by default.

**PAGE STRUCTURE:**
1. **Header**: Minimalist navigation with Pulse logo (left) and "Start Training" primary button (right).
2. **Hero Section**: Large, emotive fitness photography background. Headline: "Elevate Every Beat." Sub-headline: "Track, analyze, and crush your fitness goals with Pulse." Primary red CTA: "Get Started".
3. **Feature Grid**: Three-column layout highlighting:
    - **Real-time Tracking**: Live stats from your wearable.
    - **AI Coaching**: Personalized workouts based on your performance.
    - **Community Challenges**: Compete with friends and stay motivated.
4. **Social Proof Section**: Subtle slider showing "Trusted by 500,000+ athletes".
5. **Footer**: Quick links (Training, Pricing, Support), social icons, and legal.

---
💡 **Tip**: Notice how the enhanced prompt adds specific hex codes, defines the typography "vibe", and breaks the page into a logical numbered structure. This gives Stitch much clearer instructions.

description: Edit an existing design screen using Stitch MCP.
---

# Workflow: Edit-Design

Make targeted changes to an already generated design.

## Steps

### 1. Identify the Screen
Use `list_screens` or `get_screen` to find the correct `projectId` and `screenId`.

### 2. Formulate the Edit Prompt
Be specific about the changes you want to make. Do not just say "fix it". 
- **Location**: "Change the color of the [primary button] in the [hero section]..."
- **Visuals**: "...to a darker blue (#004080) and add a subtle shadow."
- **Structure**: "Add a secondary button next to the primary one with the text 'Learn More'."

### 3. Apply the Edit
Call the `mcp_StitchMCP_edit_screens` tool.

```json
{
  "projectId": "...",
  "selectedScreenIds": ["..."],
  "prompt": "[Your target edit prompt]"
}
```

### 4. Present AI Feedback
Always show the text description and suggestions from `outputComponents` to the user.

### 5. Download Design Assets
After editing, download the updated HTML and screenshot urls from `outputComponents` to the `.stitch/designs` directory, overwriting previous versions to ensure the local files reflect the latest edits.

### 6. Verify and Repeat
- Check the output screen to see if the changes were applied correctly.
- If more polish is needed, repeat the process with a new specific prompt.

## Tips
- **Keep it focused**: One edit at a time is often better than a long list of changes.
- **Reference components**: Use professional terms like "navigation bar", "hero section", "footer", "card grid".
- **Mention colors**: Use hex codes for precise color matching.

description: Analyze a Stitch project and synthesize its design system into a .stitch/DESIGN.md file.
---

# Workflow: Generate .stitch/DESIGN.md

Create a "source of truth" for your project's design language to ensure consistency across all future screens.

## 📥 Retrieval

To analyze a Stitch project, you must retrieve metadata and assets using the Stitch MCP tools:

1.  **Project lookup**: Use `list_projects` to find the target `projectId`.
2.  **Screen lookup**: Use `list_screens` for that `projectId` to find representative screens (e.g., "Home", "Main Dashboard").
3.  **Metadata fetch**: Call `get_screen` for the target screen to get `screenshot.downloadUrl` and `htmlCode.downloadUrl`.
4.  **Asset download**: Use `read_url_content` to fetch the HTML code.

## 🧠 Analysis & Synthesis

### 1. Identify Identity
- Capture Project Title and Project ID.

### 2. Define Atmosphere
- Analyze the HTML and screenshot to capture the "vibe" (e.g., "Airy," "Professional," "Vibrant").

### 3. Map Color Palette
- Extract exact hex codes and assign functional roles (e.g., "Primary Action: #2563eb").

### 4. Translate Geometry
- Convert Tailwind/CSS values into descriptive language (e.g., `rounded-full` → "Pill-shaped").

### 5. Document Depth
- Describe shadow styles and layering (e.g., "Soft, diffused elevation").

## 📝 Output Structure

Create a `.stitch/DESIGN.md` file in the project directory with this structure:

```markdown
# Design System: [Project Title]
**Project ID:** [Insert Project ID Here]

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
(Description of mood and aesthetic philosophy)

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
(Descriptive Name + Hex Code + Role)

## 3. Typography Rules
(Font families, weights, and usage)

## 4. Component Stylings
* **Buttons:** Shape, color, behavior
* **Containers:** Roundness, elevation

## 5. Layout Principles
(Whitespace strategy and grid alignment)
```

## 💡 Best Practices
- **Be Precise**: Always include hex codes in parentheses.
- **Be Descriptive**: Use natural language like "Deep Ocean Blue" instead of just "Blue".
- **Be Functional**: Explain *why* an element is used.

description: Generate new screens from a text prompt using Stitch MCP.
---

# Workflow: Text-to-Design

Transform a text description into a high-fidelity design screen.

## Steps

### 1. Enhance the User Prompt
Before calling the Stitch MCP tool, apply the [Prompt Enhancement Pipeline](../SKILL.md#prompt-enhancement-pipeline). 
- Identify the platform (Web/Mobile) and page type.
- Incorporate any existing project design system from `.stitch/DESIGN.md`.
- Use specific [Design Mappings](../references/design-mappings.md) and [Prompting Keywords](../references/prompt-keywords.md).

### 2. Identify the Project
Use `list_projects` to find the correct `projectId` if it is not already known.

### 3. Generate the Screen
Call the `mcp_StitchMCP_generate_screen_from_text` tool with the enhanced prompt.

```json
{
  "projectId": "...",
  "prompt": "[Your Enhanced Prompt]",
  "deviceType": "DESKTOP" // or MOBILE
}
```

### 4. Present AI Feedback
Always show the text description and suggestions from `outputComponents` to the user.

### 5. Download Design Assets
After generation, download the HTML and screenshot urls from `outputComponents` to the `.stitch/designs` directory.
- **Naming**: Use the screen ID or a descriptive slug for the filename.
- **Tools**: Use `curl -o` via `run_command` or similar.
- **Directory**: Ensure `.stitch/designs` exists.

### 6. Review and Refine
- If the result is not exactly as expected, use the [edit-design](edit-design.md) workflow to make targeted adjustments.
- Do NOT re-generate from scratch unless the fundamental layout is wrong.

## Tips
- **Be structural**: Break the page down into header, hero, features, and footer in your prompt.
- **Specify colors**: Use hex codes for precision.
- **Set the tone**: Explicitly mention if the design should be minimal, professional, or vibrant.

# Stitch Design Expert

You are an expert Design Systems Lead and Prompt Engineer specializing in the **Stitch MCP server**. Your goal is to help users create high-fidelity, consistent, and professional UI designs by bridging the gap between vague ideas and precise design specifications.

## Core Responsibilities

1.  **Prompt Enhancement** — Transform rough intent into structured prompts using professional UI/UX terminology and design system context.
2.  **Design System Synthesis** — Analyze existing Stitch projects to create `.stitch/DESIGN.md` "source of truth" documents.
3.  **Workflow Routing** — Intelligently route user requests to specialized generation or editing workflows.
4.  **Consistency Management** — Ensure all new screens leverage the project's established visual language.
5.  **Asset Management** — Automatically download generated HTML and screenshots to the `.stitch/designs` directory.

---

## 🚀 Workflows

Based on the user's request, follow one of these workflows:

| User Intent | Workflow | Primary Tool |
|:---|:---|:---|
| "Design a [page]..." | [text-to-design](workflows/text-to-design.md) | `generate_screen_from_text` + `Download` |
| "Edit this [screen]..." | [edit-design](workflows/edit-design.md) | `edit_screens` + `Download` |
| "Create/Update .stitch/DESIGN.md" | [generate-design-md](workflows/generate-design-md.md) | `get_screen` + `Write` |

---

## 🎨 Prompt Enhancement Pipeline

Before calling any Stitch generation or editing tool, you MUST enhance the user's prompt.

### 1. Analyze Context
- **Project Scope**: Maintain the current `projectId`. Use `list_projects` if unknown.
- **Design System**: Check for `.stitch/DESIGN.md`. If it exists, incorporate its tokens (colors, typography). If not, suggest the `generate-design-md` workflow.

### 2. Refine UI/UX Terminology
Consult [Design Mappings](references/design-mappings.md) to replace vague terms.
- Vague: "Make a nice header"
- Professional: "Sticky navigation bar with glassmorphism effect and centered logo"

### 3. Structure the Final Prompt
Format the enhanced prompt for Stitch like this:

```markdown
[Overall vibe, mood, and purpose of the page]

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
- Platform: [Web/Mobile], [Desktop/Mobile]-first
- Palette: [Primary Name] (#hex for role), [Secondary Name] (#hex for role)
- Styles: [Roundness description], [Shadow/Elevation style]

**PAGE STRUCTURE:**
1. **Header:** [Description of navigation and branding]
2. **Hero Section:** [Headline, subtext, and primary CTA]
3. **Primary Content Area:** [Detailed component breakdown]
4. **Footer:** [Links and copyright information]
```

### 4. Present AI Insights
After any tool call, always surface the `outputComponents` (Text Description and Suggestions) to the user.

# Stitch Build Loop Skill

Teaches agents to iteratively build websites using Stitch with an autonomous baton-passing loop pattern.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add google-labs-code/stitch-skills --skill stitch-loop --global
```

## What It Does

Enables continuous, autonomous website development through a "baton" system:

1. Agent reads task from `next-prompt.md`
2. Generates page via Stitch MCP tools
3. Integrates into site structure
4. Writes next task to continue the loop

## Prerequisites

- Stitch MCP Server access
- A `DESIGN.md` file (generate with the `design-md` skill)
- A `SITE.md` file for project context

## Example Prompt

```text
Read my next-prompt.md and generate the page using Stitch, then prepare the next iteration.
```

# Stitch Build Loop

You are an **autonomous frontend builder** participating in an iterative site-building loop. Your goal is to generate a page using Stitch, integrate it into the site, and prepare instructions for the next iteration.

## Overview

The Build Loop pattern enables continuous, autonomous website development through a "baton" system. Each iteration:
1. Reads the current task from a baton file (`.stitch/next-prompt.md`)
2. Generates a page using Stitch MCP tools
3. Integrates the page into the site structure
4. Writes the next task to the baton file for the next iteration

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Access to the Stitch MCP Server
- A Stitch project (existing or will be created)
- A `.stitch/DESIGN.md` file (generate one using the `design-md` skill if needed)
- A `.stitch/SITE.md` file documenting the site vision and roadmap

**Optional:**
- Chrome DevTools MCP Server — enables visual verification of generated pages

## The Baton System

The `.stitch/next-prompt.md` file acts as a relay baton between iterations:

```markdown
---
page: about
---
A page describing how jules.top tracking works.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
[Copy from .stitch/DESIGN.md Section 6]

**Page Structure:**
1. Header with navigation
2. Explanation of tracking methodology
3. Footer with links
```

**Critical rules:**
- The `page` field in YAML frontmatter determines the output filename
- The prompt content must include the design system block from `.stitch/DESIGN.md`
- You MUST update this file before completing your work to continue the loop

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Read the Baton

Parse `.stitch/next-prompt.md` to extract:
- **Page name** from the `page` frontmatter field
- **Prompt content** from the markdown body

### Step 2: Consult Context Files

Before generating, read these files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.stitch/SITE.md` | Site vision, **Stitch Project ID**, existing pages (sitemap), roadmap |
| `.stitch/DESIGN.md` | Required visual style for Stitch prompts |

**Important checks:**
- Section 4 (Sitemap) — Do NOT recreate pages that already exist
- Section 5 (Roadmap) — Pick tasks from here if backlog exists
- Section 6 (Creative Freedom) — Ideas for new pages if roadmap is empty

### Step 3: Generate with Stitch

Use the Stitch MCP tools to generate the page:

1. **Discover namespace**: Run `list_tools` to find the Stitch MCP prefix
2. **Get or create project**: 
   - If `.stitch/metadata.json` exists, use the `projectId` from it
   - Otherwise, call `[prefix]:create_project`, then call `[prefix]:get_project` to retrieve full project details, and save them to `.stitch/metadata.json` (see schema below)
   - After generating each screen, call `[prefix]:get_project` again and update the `screens` map in `.stitch/metadata.json` with each screen's full metadata (id, sourceScreen, dimensions, canvas position)
3. **Generate screen**: Call `[prefix]:generate_screen_from_text` with:
   - `projectId`: The project ID
   - `prompt`: The full prompt from the baton (including design system block)
   - `deviceType`: `DESKTOP` (or as specified)
4. **Retrieve assets**: Before downloading, check if `.stitch/designs/{page}.html` and `.stitch/designs/{page}.png` already exist:
   - **If files exist**: Ask the user whether to refresh the designs from the Stitch project or reuse the existing local files. Only re-download if the user confirms.
   - **If files do not exist**: Proceed with download:
     - `htmlCode.downloadUrl` — Download and save as `.stitch/designs/{page}.html`
      - `screenshot.downloadUrl` — Append `=w{width}` to the URL before downloading, where `{width}` is the `width` value from the screen metadata (Google CDN serves low-res thumbnails by default). Save as `.stitch/designs/{page}.png`

### Step 4: Integrate into Site

1. Move generated HTML from `.stitch/designs/{page}.html` to `site/public/{page}.html`
2. Fix any asset paths to be relative to the public folder
3. Update navigation:
   - Find existing placeholder links (e.g., `href="#"`) and wire them to the new page
   - Add the new page to the global navigation if appropriate
4. Ensure consistent headers/footers across all pages

### Step 4.5: Visual Verification (Optional)

If the **Chrome DevTools MCP Server** is available, verify the generated page:

1. **Check availability**: Run `list_tools` to see if `chrome*` tools are present
2. **Start dev server**: Use Bash to start a local server (e.g., `npx serve site/public`)
3. **Navigate to page**: Call `[chrome_prefix]:navigate` to open `http://localhost:3000/{page}.html`
4. **Capture screenshot**: Call `[chrome_prefix]:screenshot` to capture the rendered page
5. **Visual comparison**: Compare against the Stitch screenshot (`.stitch/designs/{page}.png`) for fidelity
6. **Stop server**: Terminate the dev server process

> **Note:** This step is optional. If Chrome DevTools MCP is not installed, skip to Step 5.

### Step 5: Update Site Documentation

Modify `.stitch/SITE.md`:
- Add the new page to Section 4 (Sitemap) with `[x]`
- Remove any idea you consumed from Section 6 (Creative Freedom)
- Update Section 5 (Roadmap) if you completed a backlog item

### Step 6: Prepare the Next Baton (Critical)

**You MUST update `.stitch/next-prompt.md` before completing.** This keeps the loop alive.

1. **Decide the next page**: 
   - Check `.stitch/SITE.md` Section 5 (Roadmap) for pending items
   - If empty, pick from Section 6 (Creative Freedom)
   - Or invent something new that fits the site vision
2. **Write the baton** with proper YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
page: achievements
---
A competitive achievements page showing developer badges and milestones.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
[Copy the entire design system block from .stitch/DESIGN.md]

**Page Structure:**
1. Header with title and navigation
2. Badge grid showing unlocked/locked states
3. Progress bars for milestone tracking
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Full resource name (`projects/{id}`) |
| `projectId` | Stitch project ID (from `create_project` or `get_project`) |
| `title` | Human-readable project title |
| `designTheme` | Design system tokens: color mode, font, roundness, custom color, saturation |
| `deviceType` | Target device: `MOBILE`, `DESKTOP`, `TABLET` |
| `screens` | Map of page name → screen object. Each screen includes `id`, `sourceScreen` (resource path for MCP calls), canvas position (`x`, `y`), and dimensions (`width`, `height`) |
| `metadata.userRole` | User's role on the project (`OWNER`, `EDITOR`, `VIEWER`) |

## Orchestration Options

The loop can be driven by different orchestration layers:

| Method | How it works |
|--------|--------------|
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions triggers on `.stitch/next-prompt.md` changes |
| **Human-in-loop** | Developer reviews each iteration before continuing |
| **Agent chains** | One agent dispatches to another (e.g., Jules API) |
| **Manual** | Developer runs the agent repeatedly with the same repo |

The skill is orchestration-agnostic — focus on the pattern, not the trigger mechanism.

## Design System Integration

This skill works best with the `design-md` skill:

1. **First time setup**: Generate `.stitch/DESIGN.md` using the `design-md` skill from an existing Stitch screen
2. **Every iteration**: Copy Section 6 ("Design System Notes for Stitch Generation") into your baton prompt
3. **Consistency**: All generated pages will share the same visual language

## Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Forgetting to update `.stitch/next-prompt.md` (breaks the loop)
- ❌ Recreating a page that already exists in the sitemap
- ❌ Not including the design system block from `.stitch/DESIGN.md` in the prompt
- ❌ Leaving placeholder links (`href="#"`) instead of wiring real navigation
- ❌ Forgetting to persist `.stitch/metadata.json` after creating a new project

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Stitch generation fails | Check that the prompt includes the design system block |
| Inconsistent styles | Ensure `.stitch/DESIGN.md` is up-to-date and copied correctly |
| Loop stalls | Verify `.stitch/next-prompt.md` was updated with valid frontmatter |
| Navigation broken | Check all internal links use correct relative paths |

# Design System: Taste Standard
**Skill:** stitch-design-taste

## Configuration — Set Your Style
Adjust these dials before using this design system. They control how creative, dense, and animated the output should be. Pick the level that fits your project.

| Dial | Level | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Creativity** | `9` | `1` = Ultra-minimal, Swiss, silent, monochrome. `5` = Balanced, clean but with personality. `10` = Expressive, editorial, bold typography experiments, inline images in headlines, strong asymmetry. Default: `9` |
| **Density** | `5` | `1` = Gallery-airy, massive whitespace. `5` = Balanced sections. `10` = Cockpit-dense, data-heavy. Default: `5` |
| **Variance** | `8` | `1` = Predictable, symmetric grids. `5` = Subtle offsets. `10` = Artsy chaotic, no two sections alike. Default: `8` |
| **Motion Intent** | `6` | `1` = Static, no animation noted. `5` = Subtle hover/entrance cues. `10` = Cinematic orchestration noted in every component. Default: `6` |

> **How to use:** Change the numbers above to match your project's vibe. At **Creativity 1–3**, the system produces clean, quiet, Notion-like interfaces. At **Creativity 7–10**, expect inline image typography, dramatic scale contrast, and strong editorial layouts. The rest of the rules below adapt to your chosen levels.

---

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
A restrained, gallery-airy interface with confident asymmetric layouts and fluid spring-physics motion. The atmosphere is clinical yet warm — like a well-lit architecture studio where every element earns its place through function. Density is balanced (Level 4), variance runs high (Level 8) to prevent symmetrical boredom, and motion is fluid but never theatrical (Level 6). The overall impression: expensive, intentional, alive.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
- **Canvas White** (#F9FAFB) — Primary background surface. Warm-neutral, never clinical blue-white
- **Pure Surface** (#FFFFFF) — Card and container fill. Used with whisper shadow for elevation
- **Charcoal Ink** (#18181B) — Primary text. Zinc-950 depth — never pure black
- **Steel Secondary** (#71717A) — Body text, descriptions, metadata. Zinc-500 warmth
- **Muted Slate** (#94A3B8) — Tertiary text, timestamps, disabled states
- **Whisper Border** (rgba(226,232,240,0.5)) — Card borders, structural 1px lines. Semi-transparent for depth
- **Diffused Shadow** (rgba(0,0,0,0.05)) — Card elevation. Wide-spreading, 40px blur, -15px offset. Never harsh

### Accent Selection (Pick ONE per project)
- **Emerald Signal** (#10B981) — For growth, success, positive data dashboards
- **Electric Blue** (#3B82F6) — For productivity, SaaS, developer tools
- **Deep Rose** (#E11D48) — For creative, editorial, fashion-adjacent projects
- **Amber Warmth** (#F59E0B) — For community, social, warm-toned products

### Banned Colors
- Purple/Violet neon gradients — the "AI Purple" aesthetic
- Pure Black (#000000) — always Off-Black or Zinc-950
- Oversaturated accents above 80% saturation
- Mixed warm/cool gray systems within one project

## 3. Typography Rules
- **Display:** `Geist`, `Satoshi`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, or `Outfit` — Track-tight (`-0.025em`), controlled fluid scale, weight-driven hierarchy (700–900). Not screaming. Leading compressed (`1.1`). Alternatives forced — `Inter` is BANNED for premium contexts
- **Body:** Same family at weight 400 — Relaxed leading (`1.65`), 65ch max-width, Steel Secondary color (#71717A)
- **Mono:** `Geist Mono` or `JetBrains Mono` — For code blocks, metadata, timestamps. When density exceeds Level 7, all numbers switch to monospace
- **Scale:** Display at `clamp(2.25rem, 5vw, 3.75rem)`. Body at `1rem/1.125rem`. Mono metadata at `0.8125rem`

### Banned Fonts
- `Inter` — banned everywhere in premium/creative contexts
- Generic serif fonts (`Times New Roman`, `Georgia`, `Garamond`, `Palatino`) — BANNED. If serif is needed for editorial/creative, use only distinctive modern serifs like `Fraunces`, `Gambarino`, `Editorial New`, or `Instrument Serif`. Never use default browser serif stacks. Serif is always BANNED in dashboards or software UIs regardless

## 4. Component Stylings
* **Buttons:** Flat surface, no outer glow. Primary: accent fill with white text. Secondary: ghost/outline. Active state: `-1px translateY` or `scale(0.98)` for tactile push. Hover: subtle background shift, never glow
* **Cards/Containers:** Generously rounded corners (`2.5rem`). Pure white fill. Whisper border (`1px`, semi-transparent). Diffused shadow (`0 20px 40px -15px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`). Internal padding `2rem–2.5rem`. Used ONLY when elevation communicates hierarchy — high-density layouts replace cards with `border-top` dividers or negative space
* **Inputs/Forms:** Label positioned above input. Helper text optional. Error text below in Deep Rose. Focus ring in accent color, `2px` offset. No floating labels. Standard `0.5rem` gap between label-input-error stack
* **Navigation:** Sleek, sticky. Icons scale on hover (Dock Magnification optional). No hamburger on desktop. Clean horizontal with generous spacing
* **Loaders:** Skeletal shimmer matching exact layout dimensions and rounded corners. Shifting light reflection across placeholder shapes. Never circular spinners
* **Empty States:** Composed illustration or icon composition with guidance text. Never just "No data found"
* **Error States:** Inline, contextual. Red accent underline or border. Clear recovery action

## 5. Hero Section
The Hero is the first impression — it must be striking, creative, and never generic.
- **Inline Image Typography:** Embed small, contextual photos or visuals directly between words or letters in the headline. Example: "We build [photo of hands typing] digital [photo of screen] products" — images sit inline at type-height, rounded, acting as visual punctuation between words. This is the signature creative technique
- **No Overlapping Elements:** Text must never overlap images or other text. Every element has its own clear spatial zone. No z-index stacking of content layers, no absolute-positioned headlines over images. Clean separation always
- **No Filler Text:** "Scroll to explore", "Swipe down", scroll arrow icons, bouncing chevrons, and any instructional UI chrome are BANNED. The user knows how to scroll. Let the content pull them in naturally
- **Asymmetric Structure:** Centered Hero layouts are BANNED at this variance level. Use Split Screen (50/50), Left-Aligned text / Right visual, or Asymmetric Whitespace with large empty zones
- **CTA Restraint:** Maximum one primary CTA button. No secondary "Learn more" links. No redundant micro-copy below the headline

## 6. Layout Principles
- **Grid-First:** CSS Grid for all structural layouts. Never flexbox percentage math (`calc(33% - 1rem)` is BANNED)
- **No Overlapping:** Elements must never overlap each other. No absolute-positioned layers stacking content on content. Every element occupies its own grid cell or flow position. Clean, separated spatial zones
- **Feature Sections:** The "3 equal cards in a row" pattern is BANNED. Use 2-column Zig-Zag, asymmetric Bento grids (2fr 1fr 1fr), or horizontal scroll galleries
- **Containment:** All content within `max-width: 1400px`, centered. Generous horizontal padding (`1rem` mobile, `2rem` tablet, `4rem` desktop)
- **Full-Height:** Use `min-height: 100dvh` — never `height: 100vh` (iOS Safari address bar jump)
- **Bento Architecture:** For feature grids, use Row 1: 3 columns | Row 2: 2 columns (70/30 split). Each tile contains a perpetual micro-animation

## 7. Responsive Rules
Every screen must work flawlessly across all viewports. **Responsive is not optional — it is a hard requirement. Every single element must be tested at 375px, 768px, and 1440px.**
- **Mobile-First Collapse (< 768px):** All multi-column layouts collapse to a strict single column. `width: 100%`, `padding: 1rem`, `gap: 1.5rem`. No exceptions
- **No Horizontal Scroll:** Horizontal overflow on mobile is a critical failure. All elements must fit within viewport width. If any element causes horizontal scroll, the design is broken
- **Typography Scaling:** Headlines scale down gracefully via `clamp()`. Body text stays `1rem` minimum. Never shrink body below `14px`. Headlines must remain readable on 375px screens
- **Touch Targets:** All interactive elements minimum `44px` tap target. Generous spacing between clickable items. Buttons must be full-width on mobile
- **Image Behavior:** Hero and inline images scale proportionally. Inline typography images (photos between words) stack below the headline on mobile instead of inline
- **Navigation:** Desktop horizontal nav collapses to a clean mobile menu (slide-in or full-screen overlay). No tiny hamburger icons without labels
- **Cards & Grids:** Bento grids and asymmetric layouts revert to stacked single-column cards with full-width. Maintain internal padding (`1rem`)
- **Spacing Consistency:** Vertical section gaps reduce proportionally on mobile (`clamp(3rem, 8vw, 6rem)`). Never cramped, never excessively airy
- **Testing Viewports:** Designs must be verified at: `375px` (iPhone SE), `390px` (iPhone 14), `768px` (iPad), `1024px` (small laptop), `1440px` (desktop)

## 8. Motion & Interaction (Code-Phase Intent)
> **Note:** Stitch generates static screens — it does not animate. This section documents the **intended motion behavior** so that the coding agent (Antigravity, Cursor, etc.) knows exactly how to implement animations when building the exported design into a live product.

- **Physics Engine:** Spring-based exclusively. `stiffness: 100, damping: 20`. No linear easing anywhere. Premium, weighty feel on all interactive elements
- **Perpetual Micro-Loops:** Every active dashboard component has an infinite-loop state — Pulse on status dots, Typewriter on search bars, Float on feature icons, Shimmer on loading states
- **Staggered Orchestration:** Lists and grids mount with cascaded delays (`animation-delay: calc(var(--index) * 100ms)`). Waterfall reveals, never instant mount
- **Layout Transitions:** Smooth re-ordering via shared element IDs. Items swap positions with physics, simulating real-time intelligence
- **Hardware Rules:** Animate ONLY `transform` and `opacity`. Never `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`. Grain/noise filters on fixed, pointer-events-none pseudo-elements only
- **Performance:** CPU-heavy perpetual animations isolated in microscopic leaf components. Never trigger parent re-renders. Target 60fps minimum

## 9. Anti-Patterns (Banned)
- No emojis — anywhere in UI, code, or alt text
- No `Inter` font — use `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, `Satoshi`
- No generic serif fonts (`Times New Roman`, `Georgia`, `Garamond`) — if serif is needed, use distinctive modern serifs only (`Fraunces`, `Instrument Serif`)
- No pure black (`#000000`) — Off-Black or Zinc-950 only
- No neon outer glows or default box-shadow glows
- No oversaturated accent colors above 80%
- No excessive gradient text on large headers
- No custom mouse cursors
- No overlapping elements — text never overlaps images or other content. Clean spatial separation always
- No 3-column equal card layouts for features
- No centered Hero sections (at this variance level)
- No filler UI text: "Scroll to explore", "Swipe down", "Discover more below", scroll arrows, bouncing chevrons — all BANNED
- No generic names: "John Doe", "Sarah Chan", "Acme", "Nexus", "SmartFlow"
- No fake round numbers: `99.99%`, `50%`, `1234567` — use organic data: `47.2%`, `+1 (312) 847-1928`
- No fabricated data or statistics — never generate metrics, performance numbers, uptime percentages, response times, or any data not explicitly provided by the user. "99.98% UPTIME SLA", "124ms AVG. RESPONSE", "18.5k DEPLOY CYCLES" are invented AI filler. Use `[metric]` placeholders if real data is unavailable
- No fake system/metric sections — "SYSTEM PERFORMANCE METRICS", "KEY STATISTICS", "BY THE NUMBERS" dashboard cards filled with invented data are BANNED
- No `LABEL // YEAR` formatting — "SYSTEM // 2024", "METRICS // 2025" is a lazy AI convention, not real design typography
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen", "Revolutionize"
- No broken Unsplash links — use `picsum.photos/seed/{id}/800/600` or SVG UI Avatars
- No generic `shadcn/ui` defaults — customize radii, colors, shadows to match this system
- No `z-index` spam — use only for Navbar, Modal, Overlay layer contexts
- No `h-screen` — always `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No circular loading spinners — skeletal shimmer only

# Stitch Design Taste — Semantic Design System Skill

## Overview
This skill generates `DESIGN.md` files optimized for Google Stitch screen generation. It translates the battle-tested anti-slop frontend engineering directives into Stitch's native semantic design language — descriptive, natural-language rules paired with precise values that Stitch's AI agent can interpret to produce premium, non-generic interfaces.

The generated `DESIGN.md` serves as the **single source of truth** for prompting Stitch to generate new screens that align with a curated, high-agency design language. Stitch interprets design through **"Visual Descriptions"** supported by specific color values, typography specs, and component behaviors.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Google Stitch via [labs.google.com/stitch](https://labs.google.com/stitch)
- Optionally: Stitch MCP Server for programmatic integration with Cursor, Antigravity, or Gemini CLI

## The Goal
Generate a `DESIGN.md` file that encodes:
1. **Visual atmosphere** — the mood, density, and design philosophy
2. **Color calibration** — neutrals, accents, and banned patterns with hex codes
3. **Typographic architecture** — font stacks, scale hierarchy, and anti-patterns
4. **Component behaviors** — buttons, cards, inputs with interaction states
5. **Layout principles** — grid systems, spacing philosophy, responsive strategy
6. **Motion philosophy** — animation engine specs, spring physics, perpetual micro-interactions
7. **Anti-patterns** — explicit list of banned AI design clichés

## Analysis & Synthesis Instructions

### 1. Define the Atmosphere
Evaluate the target project's intent. Use evocative adjectives from the taste spectrum:
- **Density:** "Art Gallery Airy" (1–3) → "Daily App Balanced" (4–7) → "Cockpit Dense" (8–10)
- **Variance:** "Predictable Symmetric" (1–3) → "Offset Asymmetric" (4–7) → "Artsy Chaotic" (8–10)
- **Motion:** "Static Restrained" (1–3) → "Fluid CSS" (4–7) → "Cinematic Choreography" (8–10)

Default baseline: Creativity 9, Variance 8, Motion 6, Density 5. Adapt dynamically based on user's vibe description.

### 2. Map the Color Palette
For each color provide: **Descriptive Name** + **Hex Code** + **Functional Role**.

**Mandatory constraints:**
- Maximum 1 accent color. Saturation below 80%
- The "AI Purple/Blue Neon" aesthetic is strictly BANNED — no purple button glows, no neon gradients
- Use absolute neutral bases (Zinc/Slate) with high-contrast singular accents
- Stick to one palette for the entire output — no warm/cool gray fluctuation
- Never use pure black (`#000000`) — use Off-Black, Zinc-950, or Charcoal

### 3. Establish Typography Rules
- **Display/Headlines:** Track-tight, controlled scale. Not screaming. Hierarchy through weight and color, not just massive size
- **Body:** Relaxed leading, max 65 characters per line
- **Font Selection:** `Inter` is BANNED for premium/creative contexts. Force unique character: `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, or `Satoshi`
- **Serif Ban:** Generic serif fonts (`Times New Roman`, `Georgia`, `Garamond`, `Palatino`) are BANNED. If serif is needed for editorial/creative contexts, use only distinctive modern serifs: `Fraunces`, `Gambarino`, `Editorial New`, or `Instrument Serif`. Serif is always BANNED in dashboards or software UIs
- **Dashboard Constraint:** Use Sans-Serif pairings exclusively (`Geist` + `Geist Mono` or `Satoshi` + `JetBrains Mono`)
- **High-Density Override:** When density exceeds 7, all numbers must use Monospace

### 4. Define the Hero Section
The Hero is the first impression and must be creative, striking, and never generic:
- **Inline Image Typography:** Embed small, contextual photos or visuals directly between words or letters in the headline. Images sit inline at type-height, rounded, acting as visual punctuation. This is the signature creative technique
- **No Overlapping:** Text must never overlap images or other text. Every element occupies its own clean spatial zone
- **No Filler Text:** "Scroll to explore", "Swipe down", scroll arrow icons, bouncing chevrons are BANNED. The content should pull users in naturally
- **Asymmetric Structure:** Centered Hero layouts BANNED when variance exceeds 4
- **CTA Restraint:** Maximum one primary CTA. No secondary "Learn more" links

### 5. Describe Component Stylings
For each component type, describe shape, color, shadow depth, and interaction behavior:
- **Buttons:** Tactile push feedback on active state. No neon outer glows. No custom mouse cursors
- **Cards:** Use ONLY when elevation communicates hierarchy. Tint shadows to background hue. For high-density layouts, replace cards with border-top dividers or negative space
- **Inputs/Forms:** Label above input, helper text optional, error text below. Standard gap spacing
- **Loading States:** Skeletal loaders matching layout dimensions — no generic circular spinners
- **Empty States:** Composed compositions indicating how to populate data
- **Error States:** Clear, inline error reporting

### 6. Define Layout Principles
- No overlapping elements — every element occupies its own clear spatial zone. No absolute-positioned content stacking
- Centered Hero sections are BANNED when variance exceeds 4 — force Split Screen, Left-Aligned, or Asymmetric Whitespace
- The generic "3 equal cards horizontally" feature row is BANNED — use 2-column Zig-Zag, asymmetric grid, or horizontal scroll
- CSS Grid over Flexbox math — never use `calc()` percentage hacks
- Contain layouts using max-width constraints (e.g., 1400px centered)
- Full-height sections must use `min-h-[100dvh]` — never `h-screen` (iOS Safari catastrophic jump)

### 7. Define Responsive Rules
Every design must work across all viewports:
- **Mobile-First Collapse (< 768px):** All multi-column layouts collapse to single column. No exceptions
- **No Horizontal Scroll:** Horizontal overflow on mobile is a critical failure
- **Typography Scaling:** Headlines scale via `clamp()`. Body text minimum `1rem`/`14px`
- **Touch Targets:** All interactive elements minimum `44px` tap target
- **Image Behavior:** Inline typography images (photos between words) stack below headline on mobile
- **Navigation:** Desktop horizontal nav collapses to clean mobile menu
- **Spacing:** Vertical section gaps reduce proportionally (`clamp(3rem, 8vw, 6rem)`)

### 8. Encode Motion Philosophy
- **Spring Physics default:** `stiffness: 100, damping: 20` — premium, weighty feel. No linear easing
- **Perpetual Micro-Interactions:** Every active component should have an infinite loop state (Pulse, Typewriter, Float, Shimmer)
- **Staggered Orchestration:** Never mount lists instantly — use cascade delays for waterfall reveals
- **Performance:** Animate exclusively via `transform` and `opacity`. Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`. Grain/noise filters on fixed pseudo-elements only

### 9. List Anti-Patterns (AI Tells)
Encode these as explicit "NEVER DO" rules in the DESIGN.md:
- No emojis anywhere
- No `Inter` font
- No generic serif fonts (`Times New Roman`, `Georgia`, `Garamond`) — distinctive modern serifs only if needed
- No pure black (`#000000`)
- No neon/outer glow shadows
- No oversaturated accents
- No excessive gradient text on large headers
- No custom mouse cursors
- No overlapping elements — clean spatial separation always
- No 3-column equal card layouts
- No generic names ("John Doe", "Acme", "Nexus")
- No fake round numbers (`99.99%`, `50%`)
- No fabricated data or statistics — never generate metrics, performance numbers, uptime percentages, response times, or any data that the user did not explicitly provide. "99.98% UPTIME SLA", "124ms AVG. RESPONSE", "18.5k DEPLOY CYCLES" are invented AI filler. If real data is not available, use clear placeholder labels like `[metric]` instead of making up numbers
- No fake system/metric sections — "SYSTEM PERFORMANCE METRICS", "KEY STATISTICS", "BY THE NUMBERS" dashboard cards filled with invented data are BANNED
- No `LABEL // YEAR` formatting — "SYSTEM // 2024", "METRICS // 2025" is a lazy AI convention, not real design typography
- No AI copywriting clichés ("Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen")
- No filler UI text: "Scroll to explore", "Swipe down", scroll arrows, bouncing chevrons
- No broken Unsplash links — use `picsum.photos` or SVG avatars
- No centered Hero sections (for high-variance projects)

## Output Format (DESIGN.md Structure)

```markdown
# Design System: [Project Title]

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
(Evocative description of the mood, density, variance, and motion intensity.
Example: "A restrained, gallery-airy interface with confident asymmetric layouts
and fluid spring-physics motion. The atmosphere is clinical yet warm — like a
well-lit architecture studio.")

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
- **Canvas White** (#F9FAFB) — Primary background surface
- **Pure Surface** (#FFFFFF) — Card and container fill
- **Charcoal Ink** (#18181B) — Primary text, Zinc-950 depth
- **Muted Steel** (#71717A) — Secondary text, descriptions, metadata
- **Whisper Border** (rgba(226,232,240,0.5)) — Card borders, 1px structural lines
- **[Accent Name]** (#XXXXXX) — Single accent for CTAs, active states, focus rings
(Max 1 accent. Saturation < 80%. No purple/neon.)

## 3. Typography Rules
- **Display:** [Font Name] — Track-tight, controlled scale, weight-driven hierarchy
- **Body:** [Font Name] — Relaxed leading, 65ch max-width, neutral secondary color
- **Mono:** [Font Name] — For code, metadata, timestamps, high-density numbers
- **Banned:** Inter, generic system fonts for premium contexts. Serif fonts banned in dashboards.

## 4. Component Stylings
* **Buttons:** Flat, no outer glow. Tactile -1px translate on active. Accent fill for primary, ghost/outline for secondary.
* **Cards:** Generously rounded corners (2.5rem). Diffused whisper shadow. Used only when elevation serves hierarchy. High-density: replace with border-top dividers.
* **Inputs:** Label above, error below. Focus ring in accent color. No floating labels.
* **Loaders:** Skeletal shimmer matching exact layout dimensions. No circular spinners.
* **Empty States:** Composed, illustrated compositions — not just "No data" text.

## 5. Layout Principles
(Grid-first responsive architecture. Asymmetric splits for Hero sections.
Strict single-column collapse below 768px. Max-width containment.
No flexbox percentage math. Generous internal padding.)

## 6. Motion & Interaction
(Spring physics for all interactive elements. Staggered cascade reveals.
Perpetual micro-loops on active dashboard components. Hardware-accelerated
transforms only. Isolated Client Components for CPU-heavy animations.)

## 7. Anti-Patterns (Banned)
(Explicit list of forbidden patterns: no emojis, no Inter, no pure black,
no neon glows, no 3-column equal grids, no AI copywriting clichés,
no generic placeholder names, no broken image links.)
```

## Best Practices
- **Be Descriptive:** "Deep Charcoal Ink (#18181B)" — not just "dark text"
- **Be Functional:** Explain what each element is used for
- **Be Consistent:** Same terminology throughout the document
- **Be Precise:** Include exact hex codes, rem values, pixel values in parentheses
- **Be Opinionated:** This is not a neutral template — it enforces a specific, premium aesthetic

## Tips for Success
1. Start with the atmosphere — understand the vibe before detailing tokens
2. Look for patterns — identify consistent spacing, sizing, and styling
3. Think semantically — name colors by purpose, not just appearance
4. Consider hierarchy — document how visual weight communicates importance
5. Encode the bans — anti-patterns are as important as the rules themselves

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Using technical jargon without translation ("rounded-xl" instead of "generously rounded corners")
- Omitting hex codes or using only descriptive names
- Forgetting functional roles of design elements
- Being too vague in atmosphere descriptions
- Ignoring the anti-pattern list — these are what make the output premium
- Defaulting to generic "safe" designs instead of enforcing the curated aesthetic
